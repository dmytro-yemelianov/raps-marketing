## Rate Justification Points

When clients question rates, reference:

1. **Specialized Expertise**
   - "APS expertise is rare - there are fewer than 500 active Forge/APS developers globally"
   - "My solutions are validated against official Autodesk OpenAPI specifications"

2. **Production Quality**
   - "Zero-runtime-dependency binaries that work across all platforms"
   - "Enterprise-grade code with comprehensive error handling"

3. **Open Source Credibility**
   - "Creator of RAPS, the most comprehensive open-source APS CLI"
   - "Active GitHub contributor with production-tested code"

4. **Cost Savings**
   - "Automation typically saves 10-50 hours/week of manual work"
   - "Preventing API mistakes saves thousands in debugging"
