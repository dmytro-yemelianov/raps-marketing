Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for the successful project! If you have a moment, I'd really appreciate a brief testimonial I could use in my portfolio. 

A few questions that might help:
- What challenge were you facing before we worked together?
- What results did the project deliver?
- What stood out about working with me?

Feel free to keep it short - even 2-3 sentences would be valuable.
