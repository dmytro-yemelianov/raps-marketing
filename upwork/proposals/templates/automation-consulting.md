## Proposal Template

```
Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for sharing details about your [APS/automation/CAD] challenges. I understand you're looking for expert guidance on [summarize their situation], and I can help.

**MY CONSULTING APPROACH**

Rather than just delivering code, I focus on enabling your team for long-term success. My consulting engagements typically include:

• Understanding your current state and goals
• Identifying quick wins and strategic improvements
• Creating actionable recommendations with priorities
• Knowledge transfer to your team
• Optional: hands-on implementation support

**RELEVANT EXPERTISE**

As the creator of RAPS (the most comprehensive APS CLI), I've worked extensively with:

[Select relevant items:]
• Autodesk Platform Services architecture and best practices
• CI/CD pipeline design for CAD/BIM workflows
• Enterprise integration patterns
• Authentication and security hardening
• Performance optimization
• Cloud cost management

**WHAT I'VE OBSERVED ABOUT YOUR SITUATION**

[Based on their description, note 2-3 specific observations or potential issues]

**PROPOSED ENGAGEMENT**

I recommend starting with a **Discovery & Assessment** phase:

Phase 1: Discovery (1 week)
• Stakeholder interviews (up to 4 hours)
• Review existing architecture/code
• Understand pain points and goals
• Assess current vs. desired state

Phase 2: Analysis & Recommendations (1 week)
• Document findings
• Prioritize opportunities (quick wins vs. strategic)
• Create architectural recommendations
• Define success metrics

Deliverables:
• Assessment Report (10-20 pages)
• Architecture Recommendations
• Implementation Roadmap
• Risk Register

**OPTIONAL FOLLOW-ON**

After assessment, we can discuss:
• Implementation support (hourly or fixed)
• Training workshops for your team
• Ongoing advisory retainer
• Code review and quality assurance

**INVESTMENT**

Discovery & Assessment: $[X,000 - typically $3,500-7,500]
• All deliverables listed above
• Presentation to stakeholders
• 2 weeks of follow-up questions

This is a fixed price regardless of hours - I'm confident in my process.

**NEXT STEPS**

I'd like to schedule a 30-minute introductory call (no charge) to:
• Understand your situation in more depth
• Answer any questions about my approach
• Determine if we're a good fit

Available times: [suggest 2-3 options]

Looking forward to learning more about your challenges.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Specific Consulting Scenarios

### Architecture Review
```
**ARCHITECTURE REVIEW FOCUS**

I'll evaluate:
• API integration patterns and error handling
• Authentication flow security
• Scalability considerations
• Performance bottlenecks
• Code maintainability
• Testing coverage
• Documentation completeness

Deliverable: Architecture Review Report with prioritized recommendations
Duration: 1-2 weeks depending on codebase size
Investment: $5,000-15,000
```

### Migration Consulting (Forge → APS)
```
**FORGE TO APS MIGRATION**

I'll help you navigate the migration:
• Audit current Forge usage
• Map deprecated endpoints to APS equivalents
• Identify breaking changes
• Create migration plan with testing strategy
• Support during cutover

Common areas requiring attention:
• Endpoint URL changes
• OAuth scope updates
• Response format differences
• Rate limiting changes
```

### Performance Optimization
```
**PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**

I'll analyze and optimize:
• API call patterns (reduce, batch, cache)
• File upload/download efficiency
• Translation pipeline throughput
• Concurrent operation tuning
• Cloud credit optimization

Typical improvements: 50-80% reduction in processing time
```

## Objection Handling

### "That's expensive for consulting"
"I understand budget is a consideration. The assessment typically pays for itself by identifying one or two high-impact improvements. For context, one client saved $50K annually in cloud costs from recommendations in a $5K assessment."

### "Can't you just fix it?"
"I can absolutely implement solutions. The assessment helps ensure we fix the right things in the right order. Would you prefer a combined assessment + implementation proposal?"

### "We don't have time for assessment"
"I hear you on the urgency. Let's discuss what's most critical - I may be able to do a focused review on just that area, then expand later."
