## Proposal Template

```
Hi [Client Name],

I read your requirements for [specific need] and I'm confident I can deliver exactly what you need. Let me explain why:

**RELEVANT EXPERIENCE**

I'm the creator of RAPS, the most comprehensive open-source CLI for Autodesk Platform Services (APS). This means I have hands-on, production-tested experience with:

[Select relevant items:]
• Authentication APIs (2-legged, 3-legged OAuth, device code)
• Object Storage Service for file management
• Model Derivative API for CAD translations
• Data Management API for BIM 360/ACC
• Design Automation for AutoCAD/Revit automation
• Construction Cloud APIs (Issues, RFIs, Assets)
• Webhooks for event-driven architectures

**UNDERSTANDING YOUR PROJECT**

Based on your description, here's what I understand you need:
[Paraphrase their requirements - show you read the posting]

**PROPOSED APPROACH**

1. **Discovery Call** (free): 30-minute call to align on requirements
2. **Technical Design**: Architecture document with your approval
3. **Implementation**: [Estimated timeline based on scope]
4. **Testing & Documentation**: Comprehensive testing + docs
5. **Handover**: Knowledge transfer and support period

**DELIVERABLES**

• [List specific deliverables based on their needs]
• Clean, documented code
• Integration tests
• Setup/deployment documentation
• [X] days of post-delivery support

**TIMELINE & INVESTMENT**

Based on the scope, I estimate:
• Duration: [X] weeks
• Investment: $[X,XXX]

I'm also happy to discuss hourly engagement if you prefer flexibility.

**NEXT STEPS**

Would a quick call work this week to discuss your requirements in detail? I'm available [suggest 2-3 times].

Looking forward to helping you [achieve their stated goal].

Best regards,
[Your Name]

- Mention device code flow for CI/CD scenarios

### For BIM 360/ACC Focus
Add:
- "I have deep experience with ACC APIs including Issues, RFIs, Submittals, and Checklists"
- Mention 3-legged auth complexity

### For Translation/Model Derivative Focus
Add:
- "I've processed thousands of translations including edge cases with complex assemblies"
- Mention format-specific experience (RVT, DWG, IFC)

### For Design Automation Focus
Add:
- "I've built production DA workflows for AutoCAD, Revit, and Inventor"

## Question Follow-ups

### Budget Questions
"For this scope, I typically see projects in the $[X]-$[Y] range. Do you have a budget range in mind? This helps me tailor the solution appropriately."

### Timeline Pressure
"The technical work takes [X] weeks minimum for quality results. If there's a hard deadline, let's discuss which features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves."

### Technology Alternatives
"While [alternative] is an option, APS integration provides [specific benefits]. Happy to discuss trade-offs on our discovery call."
