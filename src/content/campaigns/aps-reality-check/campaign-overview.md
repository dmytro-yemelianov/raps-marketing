# "APS Reality Check" Campaign Overview

## Campaign Concept

**Tagline**: "What Autodesk Doesn't Tell You About Building with APS"

**Mission**: Expose the operational reality of APS implementation and position RAPS as the essential bridge between documentation and production.

## Campaign Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Documentation Gap
**Message**: "APS docs show the happy path. We show the real path."

### Pillar 2: Enterprise Reality
**Message**: "Your POC worked. Production won't. Here's why."

### Pillar 3: Developer Liberation  
**Message**: "Stop building plumbing. Start shipping features."
