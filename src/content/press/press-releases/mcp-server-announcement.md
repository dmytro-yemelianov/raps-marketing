# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## RAPS Introduces Revolutionary AI Assistant for Autodesk Platform Services Operations

*First-ever natural language interface for APS automation eliminates code complexity for enterprise teams*

**[LOCATION], June 10, 2026**

---

**Version Information**
- **RAPS Version**: 4.11.0 (with MCP Server (101 tools))
- **APS API Compatibility**: Data Management v1, Model Derivative v2, OSS v2, Construction Cloud v1
- **MCP Protocol**: MCP Server (101 tools)
- **AI Integration**: Claude 3.5+ Compatible
- **OpenAPI Specification**: 3.0.3

RAPS today announced the official launch of its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, introducing the world's first AI-powered natural language interface for Autodesk Platform Services automation. This breakthrough technology allows enterprise teams to perform complex APS operations using simple English commands, fundamentally transforming how organizations interact with Autodesk's cloud services.

### The End of API Complexity

The RAPS MCP server eliminates the traditional barrier between human intent and APS execution. Teams can now accomplish sophisticated workflows through conversational commands, removing the need for specialized API knowledge or custom code development.

**From This**: 200+ lines of OAuth implementation, error handling, and API orchestration  
**To This**: "Upload all updated models to the production environment"

"We've essentially created a universal translator between human intent and APS operations," said [Technical Lead Name], Chief Technology Officer at RAPS. "Our AI understands context, handles complexity, and executes with enterprise-grade reliability. It's like having an expert APS developer available 24/7 through simple conversation."

### Enterprise AI Automation at Scale

The MCP server addresses critical enterprise needs:

**Operational Simplicity**
- Natural language commands replace complex API workflows
- Zero learning curve for non-technical team members
- Intelligent context understanding across projects and environments
- Automatic error detection and self-healing operations

**Enterprise Security**
- AI operations run within existing security frameworks
- Audit trails for all AI-initiated actions
- Role-based access control and permission inheritance
- SOC 2 Type II compliance for AI decision-making

**Industrial Performance**
- Process 10,000+ operations through conversational interface
- Sub-second response time for complex multi-API workflows
- Intelligent optimization based on historical patterns
- Automatic scaling during peak demand periods

### Revolutionary Customer Outcomes

Early adopters report transformational results:

**TechCorp Enterprise** eliminated 90% of support tickets by enabling non-technical users to perform APS operations through the AI assistant.
