# RAPS Success Story Guidelines for Marketing Team

## Purpose & Philosophy

These guidelines ensure RAPS success stories differentiate from traditional APS marketing by focusing on **technical implementation excellence** rather than just business outcomes.

**Core Principle**: Every story must answer "How can developers reproduce this success?"

## Target Audience Hierarchy

### Primary: Technical Decision Makers
- **DevOps Engineers**: Seeking automation solutions
- **Engineering Managers**: Evaluating tooling investments
- **CTOs/VP Engineering**: Assessing technical risk and ROI

### Secondary: Business Stakeholders  
- **Product Managers**: Understanding delivery acceleration
- **Operations Leaders**: Seeking efficiency improvements
- **C-Suite**: Validating strategic technology investments

## Story Architecture Standards

### 1. **Technical Credibility Requirements**

**Mandatory Elements**:
- ✅ Actual command examples with real syntax
- ✅ Before/after code comparisons
- ✅ Specific API endpoints and operations mentioned
- ✅ Quantified technical metrics (error rates, processing time, etc.)
- ✅ Architecture diagrams or workflow visualizations

**Prohibited Elements**:
- ❌ Vague technical descriptions ("integrated seamlessly")
- ❌ Business jargon without technical backing
- ❌ Unverifiable claims ("enterprise-grade" without metrics)
- ❌ Marketing speak that diminishes technical credibility

### 2. **Quantified Impact Framework**

**Required Metric Categories**:
```markdown
Technical Performance:
- Processing time improvements (Before: X hours → After: Y minutes)
- Error rate reductions (Before: X% → After: Y%)
- Team productivity metrics (Manual steps: X → Automated: Y)
- Infrastructure efficiency (Resources: X → Y)

Business Impact:
- Cost savings (Quantified annually)
- Time-to-market acceleration (Feature delivery speed)
- Risk reduction (Downtime elimination, reliability improvement)
- Team capacity liberation (Hours freed for innovation)
```

**Metric Validation Standards**:
- All numbers must be verifiable with customer
- Percentages require baseline context
- Time improvements need specific measurement methodology
- Cost calculations must show clear attribution to RAPS

### 3. **Story Structure Template**

```markdown

- **Customer Validation**: Technical contact confirms accuracy
- **Update Process**: Quarterly review for product evolution alignment

### Credibility Markers
- **Real Customer Names**: No anonymous "Company X" stories
- **Specific Technologies**: Exact versions, APIs, and configurations mentioned
- **GitHub Repositories**: Link to implementation examples when possible
- **Contact References**: Customer technical contact available for verification

### Depth Requirements
- **Minimum Length**: 2,500 words (comprehensive implementation guide)
- **Code Examples**: 5+ actual command/configuration samples
- **Metrics**: 10+ quantified improvements documented
- **Technical Diagrams**: Visual representation of architecture/workflow

## Competitive Positioning Guidelines

### Against Autodesk Native Tooling
**Message**: "RAPS provides the missing operational layer"
- Position as complement, not replacement
- Focus on DevOps/automation gap in APS ecosystem
- Emphasize enterprise operational requirements

### Against Custom Development
**Message**: "Proven patterns vs. reinventing infrastructure"
- Highlight time-to-production advantage
- Compare maintenance overhead
- Demonstrate reliability through battle-tested implementations

### Against Alternative CLI Tools
**Message**: "APS-native optimization vs. generic solutions"
- Showcase APS-specific functionality
- Compare performance optimizations
- Highlight domain expertise advantages
