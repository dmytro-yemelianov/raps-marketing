🏢 The AEC Industry's DevOps Moment Is Here

15 years ago, software development transformed with CI/CD. Today, I see the same transformation starting in AEC.

Signs we're at the inflection point:
📈 80% of AU 2025 sessions mentioned "automation"
🔄 Major firms hiring DevOps engineers specifically for design workflows
⚡ AI integration becoming table stakes, not competitive advantage
🛠️ Platform APIs maturing beyond "upload and pray"

The question isn't whether your organization will adopt infrastructure-as-code for design workflows.

The question is whether you'll lead the transformation or follow it.

What are you seeing in your organization?

🎉 Community Win: 40 Hours/Week Saved with Automated Pipelines

Shoutout to [Company/Individual] for sharing how they transformed their model processing workflow:

Before RAPS:
❌ Manual uploads taking 2-3 hours daily
❌ Checking translation status every 15 minutes
❌ Weekend work to meet project deadlines
❌ Inconsistent quality checks

After RAPS:
✅ Automated pipeline triggered by Git commits
✅ Parallel processing of multiple formats
✅ Slack notifications when jobs complete
✅ Built-in quality validation and reporting

Result: 40 hours/week back to focus on design, not process management.

This is what modern AEC workflows should look like. 🌼
