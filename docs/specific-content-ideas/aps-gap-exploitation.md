```
[EXPECTATION - Left Screen]
"Just follow the OAuth tutorial!"
*Shows clean 10-line example from docs*

[REALITY - Right Screen]  
*Shows 200+ lines of production code*
- Token refresh logic
- Error handling
- Multi-environment management
- Secret rotation
- Audit logging

[RAPS - Full Screen]
*Single command: raps auth login*
"Or just use RAPS and move on with your life"
```

### **Episode 2: "Uploading 10,000 Files"**
**Visual Comparison**:
- Manual: Progress bar stuck at 2% after 1 hour
- RAPS: Blazing through with parallel uploads
- Error counter: Manual (247 errors), RAPS (0 errors)
- Time elapsed: Manual (14 hours), RAPS (12 minutes)

### **Episode 3: "The CI/CD Integration Lie"**
**Three-Act Structure**:
1. The Promise: "Easy GitHub Actions integration!"
2. The Reality: 500+ lines of custom workflow
3. The Solution: 5-line RAPS workflow

## 3. Interactive Tools Suite

### **Tool 1: "The APS Complexity Calculator"**
```javascript
// User inputs their APS use case
inputs: {
  operations_per_day: 1000,
  file_sizes: "10-500MB",
  environments: ["dev", "staging", "prod"],
  team_size: 5,
  error_tolerance: "low"
}

// Calculator outputs
results: {
  manual_implementation: {
    development_time: "3 months",
    lines_of_code: "5,000+",
    maintenance_hours_per_month: 40,
    error_rate: "15%",
    total_cost: "$150,000"
  },
  with_raps: {
    implementation_time: "3 days",
    lines_of_code: "50",
    maintenance_hours_per_month: 2,
    error_rate: "0.1%",
    total_cost: "$5,000"
  }
}
```

### **Tool 2: "APS Operation Time Estimator"**
```markdown
Select your operation:
□ Upload 1,000 DWG files
□ Process 500 Revit models  
□ Generate thumbnails for 10,000 items
□ Migrate data between buckets
□ Set up multi-region deployment

[Calculate Time]

Results:
- Manual approach: 47 hours of development + 8 hours execution
- RAPS approach: 30 minutes total
- Time saved: 54.5 hours (98% reduction)
```

### **Tool 3: "The APS Horror Story Generator"**
```markdown
Mix and match your nightmare:
- "It was [TIME] when [EVENT] happened..."
- "We had [NUMBER] hours until the deadline..."
- "The [APS_SERVICE] started returning [ERROR]..."
- "Our [TEAM_MEMBER] tried to [ACTION]..."
- "After [DURATION] of debugging..."
