Not because you did anything wrong, but because SDK versioning in the CAD world follows the \"break everything annually\" philosophy.\r\n\r\n### SOLIDWORKS: The Interop DLL Nightmare Champion\r\n\r\nSOLIDWORKS takes the crown for version compatibility disasters. Here's what developers face:\r\n\r\n**The Annual Breaking Change Ritual**\r\n- Every major version breaks interop DLLs\r\n- Add-ins must be rebuilt for each release\r\n- Running multiple SOLIDWORKS versions? Prepare for path management hell\r\n\r\n**Real Error Messages That Haunt Developers:**\r\n```\r\nError CS1705 Assembly 'AngelSix.SolidDna' uses \r\n'SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished, Version=26.0.1.1' \r\nwhich has a higher version than the referenced assembly\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The VBA 7.1 Apocalypse**\r\nSOLIDWORKS 2021 SP2 introduced VBA 7.1, instantly breaking every existing macro:\r\n- Earlier Installation Managers don't recognize VBA 7.1 components\r\n- Macros written pre-2021 simply stop working\r\n- No backward compatibility\r\n- No migration tools\r\n\r\n### PTC Creo: Visual Studio Dependency Roulette\r\n\r\nCreo Toolkit adds its own special flavor of version hell:\r\n- Must recompile for **each Creo version**\r\n- Toolkit libraries have Visual Studio version dependencies\r\n- \"Always forward compatible but never backward\"\r\n- The GCRI plugin for backward compatibility? Dropped at Creo 7\r\n\r\nOne developer's summary: \"If you're on Creo 8, you can't open Creo 9 files. Period.\"\r\n\r\n### Siemens NX: The Six-Month Breaking Change Cycle\r\n\r\nWhile others break annually, NX innovates with **six-month functional releases**:\r\n- \"NX Open functionality may change\"\r\n- \"New prerequisites may be needed\"\r\n- Critical bugs require community-maintained patches\r\n- GitHub repos exist specifically to fix Teamcenter 12.2 SOA crashes\r\n\r\n### The Hidden Costs\r\n\r\n**Developer Time Tax**\r\n- 2-3 weeks annually rebuilding for new versions\r\n- Testing across multiple versions\r\n- Maintaining separate codebases\r\n- Documentation updates for version-specific quirks\r\n\r\n**Enterprise Deployment Nightmares**\r\n- Can't upgrade until all add-ins are rebuilt\r\n- Different departments on different versions\r\n- Integration failures between version-mismatched systems\r\n- Testing matrix grows exponentially\r\n\r\n### The IModelDoc2 Interface: 700+ Members of Confusion\r\n\r\nSOLIDWORKS's `IModelDoc2` perfectly exemplifies the problem:\r\n- Over 700 members split across extension objects\r\n- \"No real logic in the separation\"\r\n- Documentation doesn't mention the split\r\n- Version changes shuffle members randomly\r\n\r\n### Why This Validates RAPS's Approach\r\n\r\nRAPS's architecture anticipates version conflicts:\r\n- Workspace crates allow version-specific implementations\r\n- Plugin system enables version-specific handlers\r\n- CLI abstraction shields users from API changes\r\n- Single binary works across multiple APS versions\r\n\r\n### The Market Reality\r\n\r\n| Platform | Breaking Change Frequency | Developer Impact |\r\n|----------|---------------------------|------------------|\r\n| SOLIDWORKS | Annual (100% breaking) | Rebuild everything |\r\n| Creo | Per major version | Full recompilation |\r\n| NX Open | 6 months | Continuous updates |\r\n| Revit/APS | Annual (partial) | Selective updates |\r\n\r\n### The Billion-Dollar Opportunity\r\n\r\nConsider the math:\r\n- 100,000+ CAD API developers globally\r\n- 2-3 weeks annually on version updates\r\n- $150/hour average developer cost\r\n- = **$600M+ in annual version compatibility costs**\r\n\r\nA tool that abstracts version differences could capture significant value from this waste.\r\n\r\n### Competitive Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Worst Offenders:**\r\n1. SOLIDWORKS - Complete interop breaks annually\r\n2. NX Open - Fastest breaking change cycle (6 months)\r\n3. Creo - No backward compatibility by design\r\n\r\n**Best (Least Worst):**\r\n- Onshape - REST API provides more stability\r\n- Cloud platforms - Can version endpoints separately\r\n\r\n### The Path Forward\r\n\r\nVersion compatibility tools should:\r\n1. Detect SDK/interop mismatches before runtime\r\n2. Provide compatibility matrices\r\n3. Suggest specific version combinations\r\n4. Abstract API changes behind stable interfaces\r\n5. Maintain backward compatibility layers\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\n\r\nOur next article dives into documentation disasters—where Windchill developers beg for \"Hello World\" examples, and NX documentation isn't even installed by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Part of our \"Cross-Platform Developer Pain Points\" series.

Tools\r\n\r\n*New version delivers 95% faster APS operations, enterprise SSO, and AI-powered natural language interface*\r\n\r\n**[LOCATION], March 15, 2026**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Version Information**\r\n- **RAPS Version**: 4.0.0 (LTS Release)\r\n- **APS API Compatibility**: Data Management v1, Model Derivative v2, OSS v2, Authentication v2\r\n- **MCP Protocol**: v1.0.0 \r\n- **OpenAPI Specification**: 3.0.3\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRAPS (Rust-based APS CLI), the leading automation tool for Autodesk Platform Services, today announced the release of RAPS 4.0, featuring groundbreaking enterprise capabilities and AI integration that transforms how organizations interact with APS APIs. The new version addresses critical gaps in enterprise APS operations, delivering unprecedented speed, security, and simplicity.\r\n\r\n### Key Innovation: From Code to Conversation\r\n\r\nRAPS 4.0 introduces the industry's first natural language interface for APS operations through its integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

Here's the streamlined approach:\r\n\r\n**Quick Setup:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Set your credentials once\r\nexport APS_CLIENT_ID=\"your_client_id\"\r\nexport APS_CLIENT_SECRET=\"your_client_secret\"\r\n\r\n# Test the connection\r\nraps auth test\r\n✓ 2-legged authentication successful\r\n\r\n# For 3-legged workflows\r\nraps auth login\r\n# Opens browser, handles full OAuth flow\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why this approach works better:**\r\n✅ Automatic token refresh handling\r\n✅ Built-in retry logic for network issues\r\n✅ Proper error messages vs. cryptic HTTP codes\r\n✅ Works consistently across environments\r\n\r\n**Full authentication guide**: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/auth\r\n\r\nThe manual token management you're wrestling with becomes a non-issue when the tool handles it properly.

Here's how to handle it properly:\r\n\r\n**Your Current Approach Issues:**\r\n- Manual polling every X seconds wastes API calls\r\n- No exponential backoff leads to rate limiting\r\n- Hard to handle multiple translations simultaneously\r\n- Error states often go unhandled\r\n\r\n**RAPS Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Simple case - translate and wait\r\nraps translate start $URN --format svf2 --wait\r\n# Handles all polling automatically, returns when complete\r\n\r\n# Batch case - multiple files\r\nraps translate batch *.rvt --format svf2 --parallel=4\r\n# Optimizes API calls, handles failures gracefully\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What RAPS does behind the scenes:**\r\n✅ Intelligent polling intervals (starts fast, backs off)\r\n✅ Parallel translation tracking\r\n✅ Automatic retry on transient failures\r\n✅ Progress reporting and status updates\r\n\r\n**For custom polling logic**: Check the source code at [GitHub link] - the polling algorithm is well-documented and you can adapt the pattern.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/translation\r\n\r\nHope this saves you the debugging time! Translation workflows are tricky to get right.\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Dmytro Yemelianov | Built RAPS to solve exactly these automation challenges*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Template Category 2: Educational + RAPS Context**\r\n\r\n#### **General APS Architecture Questions**\r\n```markdown\r\nGreat architecture question! Let me break down how [APS concept] works and then show you a practical implementation.\r\n\r\n**Understanding [APS Concept]:**\r\n[2-3 paragraphs of educational content explaining the concept thoroughly]\r\n\r\n**Implementation Considerations:**\r\nWhen implementing this in production, you'll want to consider:\r\n- Error handling and retry logic\r\n- Rate limiting and API quotas  \r\n- Authentication token management\r\n- Monitoring and observability\r\n\r\n**Practical Implementation:**\r\nWhile you can certainly build this from scratch using the raw APIs, there's significant complexity in handling edge cases properly. Here's how RAPS approaches it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[RAPS commands that demonstrate the concept]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why the abstraction helps:**\r\n- Handles the 80% of edge cases you haven't thought of yet\r\n- Battle-tested retry logic and error handling\r\n- Consistent behavior across different APS services\r\n- Built-in monitoring and logging capabilities\r\n\r\n**Learning Resources:**\r\n- Official APS docs: [link]\r\n- RAPS implementation: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/[relevant-section]\r\n- Example workflows: [GitHub examples link]\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask follow-up questions about any part of this!\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Dmytro Yemelianov | Expert Elite | Helping teams automate APS workflows*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Template Category 3: Troubleshooting + RAPS Alternative**\r\n\r\n#### **Complex Technical Debugging**\r\n```markdown\r\nI see several potential issues in your approach. Let me help debug this step by step:\r\n\r\n**Immediate Issues to Fix:**\r\n1. [Specific technical issue 1 with solution]\r\n2. [Specific technical issue 2 with solution]\r\n3. [Specific technical issue 3 with solution]\r\n\r\n**Code Review:**\r\nLooking at your example, here are the problems:\r\n```[language]\r\n// Your code with comments explaining issues\r\n[user's code with inline comments about problems]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Corrected Approach:**\r\n```[language]\r\n// Fixed version with explanations\r\n[corrected code with explanations]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**However, this highlights a broader pattern...**\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the kind of complexity that leads teams to adopt automation tools. You're reinventing error handling, retry logic, and authentication management - which is time-consuming and error-prone.\r\n\r\n**Alternative Approach with RAPS:**\r\n```bash\r\n# The same workflow, but tool handles complexity\r\n[RAPS commands that accomplish the same goal]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why this matters:**\r\n- Your time is better spent on business logic than infrastructure plumbing\r\n- Production systems need robust error handling (which is hard to get right)\r\n- Automation tools handle edge cases you haven't encountered yet\r\n- Team knowledge transfer becomes easier with standardized approaches\r\n\r\n**Both paths are valid** - if you want to build it yourself, the corrections above should help. If you want to focus on higher-value work, the automation approach might save weeks of debugging.\r\n\r\nLet me know which direction makes sense for your project!\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Dmytro Yemelianov | I've debugged these patterns hundreds of times*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Template Category 4: Advanced Enterprise Topics**\r\n\r\n#### **Enterprise Architecture Questions**\r\n```markdown\r\nExcellent question about enterprise-scale [topic]!

to view 3D models in my web application\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Model Derivative API** → Convert files to web-viewable formats\r\n- **Viewer SDK** → Display models in browser\r\n- **Object Storage Service** → Store original files\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: 5+ API calls, complex geometry handling\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps auth login\r\nraps oss upload model.rvt mybucket\r\nraps translate $(raps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:mybucket:model.rvt\") --wait\r\nraps view $(raps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:mybucket:model.rvt\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth (server apps) or 3-legged (user apps)  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `data:read`, `viewables:read`, `bucket:read`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. 📁 BIM 360/ACC File Management\r\n\r\n**\"I need to access files from BIM 360 or Autodesk Construction Cloud projects\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Data Management API** → Access project files and folders\r\n- **Authentication API** → User authorization (3-legged OAuth)\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Complex hub/project hierarchy navigation\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps auth login --3legged --scopes account:read,data:read\r\nraps dm projects\r\nraps dm folders \u003Cproject-id>\r\nraps dm download \u003Citem-id> ./local-file.rvt\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 3-legged OAuth (user must have project access)  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `account:read`, `data:read`, `data:write` (if uploading)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. 🔄 Batch File Processing\r\n\r\n**\"I need to convert hundreds of CAD files to different formats\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Object Storage Service** → Upload source files\r\n- **Model Derivative API** → Batch translation jobs\r\n- **Webhooks** (optional) → Get notified when translations complete\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Complex job queuing, polling, error handling\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps bucket create batch-processing\r\nraps oss upload-batch *.dwg --bucket batch-processing\r\nraps translate-batch --bucket batch-processing --formats pdf,svf2 --parallel 5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `bucket:create`, `bucket:read`, `data:read`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. 🤖 CAD Automation & Scripting\r\n\r\n**\"I want to automate repetitive tasks in AutoCAD/Revit/Inventor\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Design Automation API** → Run scripts on cloud-hosted CAD engines\r\n- **Object Storage Service** → Input/output file storage\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Complex AppBundle/Activity setup, WorkItem management\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps da engines --filter autocad\r\nraps da create-activity MyDrawingProcessor --engine Autodesk.AutoCAD+24\r\nraps da submit-workitem MyDrawingProcessor --input drawing.dwg --script process.scr\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `code:all`, `bucket:read`, `bucket:create`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5. 📊 Model Data Extraction\r\n\r\n**\"I need to extract properties, geometry, or metadata from CAD models\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Model Derivative API** → Extract properties and metadata\r\n- **Object Storage Service** or **Data Management** → Source file access\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Multi-step manifest navigation, GUID handling\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats properties\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --output properties.json\r\nraps translate metadata \u003Curn> --guid \u003Cmodel-guid>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `data:read`, `viewables:read`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## API Comparison Matrix\r\n\r\n| Use Case | Primary API | Secondary APIs | RAPS Commands | Authentication Type

|\r\n|--------|----------|----------|--------------|\r\n| **US** | `developer.api.autodesk.com` | North America, default | `raps config set region us` |\r\n| **EMEA** | `developer.api.autodesk.com` | Europe, Middle East, Africa | `raps config set region emea` |\r\n\r\n**Note:** Most APS APIs are globally distributed, but some services (like OSS buckets) have regional preferences for performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n### Once You Know Your API\r\n\r\n1. **Set Up Authentication**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   raps auth login --scopes \u003Crequired-scopes>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Test Basic Connectivity**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   raps auth status\r\n   raps \u003Capi-command> --help\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Start with RAPS Examples**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   raps examples \u003Capi-name>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Review Detailed Documentation**\r\n   - [APS Developer Portal](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/)\r\n   - [RAPS CLI Documentation](https://rapscli.xyz/docs/)\r\n\r\n### Still Not Sure?\r\n\r\n**Common Combinations:**\r\n- **Simple file viewer:** OSS + Model Derivative + Viewer SDK\r\n- **BIM 360 integration:** Data Management + Model Derivative\r\n- **Batch processing:** OSS + Design Automation\r\n- **Full construction workflow:** All APIs\r\n\r\n**Get Help:**\r\n- [APS Community Forums](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/platform-services/bd-p/42)\r\n- [RAPS Discord Community](https://discord.gg/raps-community)\r\n- [RAPS GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dmytro-yemelianov/raps/discussions)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with RAPS CLI to prototype your workflow quickly. Once you understand the API flow, you can always implement the same logic directly using HTTP requests or SDKs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last verified: January 2026 | RAPS v4.2.1 | APS APIs: Auth v2, DM v1, MD v2, OSS v2, DA v3*  \r\n*This decision tree covers 90% of APS use cases.

You're not alone. \r\n\r\n**The root cause**: Developers don't realize they must manually enable custom integrations from the ACC admin console. This isn't mentioned in most tutorials, causing hours of frustration.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Quick Fix\r\n\r\n**If you're getting 403 errors, skip to Step 3** — that's usually the missing piece.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Create APS Application\r\n\r\n**✅ Prerequisites:**\r\n- [ ] Autodesk account with developer access\r\n- [ ] Access to [aps.autodesk.com](https://aps.autodesk.com)\r\n\r\n**✅ App Creation:**\r\n- [ ] Logged into APS Developer Portal\r\n- [ ] Created new application\r\n- [ ] Noted **Client ID** (you'll need this exact value)\r\n- [ ] Noted **Client Secret** (keep secure!)\r\n- [ ] Set **Callback URL** correctly:\r\n  - Development: `http://localhost:3000/callback`\r\n  - Production: Your actual domain\r\n- [ ] Selected required **API access**:\r\n  - ✅ Data Management API\r\n  - ✅ Model Derivative API\r\n  - ✅ Any other APIs you need\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Verify ACC Admin Access\r\n\r\n**✅ Account Requirements:**\r\n- [ ] You are an **Account Admin** in ACC/BIM360 (not just Project Admin)\r\n- [ ] Your ACC subscription is active\r\n- [ ] You can access Account Administration settings\r\n\r\n**❌ If you're NOT an Account Admin:**\r\n```\r\nContact your ACC Account Admin and ask them to:\r\n1. Add your APS Client ID to custom integrations\r\n2. Grant required permissions\r\n3. Share the integration details with you\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Enable Custom Integration (CRITICAL STEP)\r\n\r\n**🚨 This step is missed by 90% of developers**\r\n\r\n**✅ In ACC Admin Console:**\r\n- [ ] Logged into ACC as **Account Admin**\r\n- [ ] Navigated to: **Account Admin → Settings → Custom Integrations**\r\n- [ ] Clicked **\"Add Custom Integration\"**\r\n- [ ] Entered your **exact Client ID** from Step 1\r\n- [ ] Selected **required access levels**:\r\n  - ✅ BIM 360 Account Admin (for account-level operations)\r\n  - ✅ BIM 360 Docs (for file operations)\r\n  - ✅ Any additional services you need\r\n- [ ] Completed the integration wizard\r\n- [ ] Waited **5-10 minutes** for propagation\r\n\r\n**⏱️ Common mistake**: Not waiting for propagation. Changes take 5-10 minutes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Per-Project Setup (If Using 2-Legged Auth)\r\n\r\n**✅ Project-Level Access:**\r\n- [ ] Added the custom integration to specific projects\r\n- [ ] Verified integration appears in Project Admin → Integrations\r\n- [ ] Granted necessary project permissions\r\n\r\n**✅ For 3-Legged Auth:**\r\n- [ ] Ensured user has project access\r\n- [ ] User accepted any pending invitations\r\n- [ ] User has appropriate role (Admin, Member, etc.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Test Authentication\r\n\r\n**✅ Basic Connection Test:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Using RAPS CLI\r\nraps auth login\r\nraps dm projects\r\n\r\n# Should list your ACC projects without 403 errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n**✅ Manual API Test:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get 3-legged token first, then:\r\ncurl -X GET \\\r\n  'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/project/v1/hubs' \\\r\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_3LEGGED_TOKEN'\r\n\r\n# Should return hub data, not 403\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔧 Troubleshooting 403 Errors\r\n\r\n### Error: \"client_id does not have access\"\r\n**❌ Cause**: Integration not added to ACC (Step 3 skipped)\r\n**✅ Fix**: Complete Step 3 — add Client ID to Custom Integrations\r\n\r\n### Error: \"User not authorized\"  \r\n**❌ Cause**: User lacks project permissions\r\n**✅ Fix**: Grant user project access or use 2-legged auth\r\n\r\n### Error: \"Project not found\"\r\n**❌ Cause**: 3-legged token from wrong user\r\n**✅ Fix**: Ensure user has access to the specific project\r\n\r\n### Error: \"Forbidden\" (generic)\r\n**❌ Cause**: Multiple possible issues\r\n**✅ Fix**: Work through checklist step by step\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🎭 Auth Flow Comparison\r\n\r\n| Auth Type | When to Use | Setup Requirements | Common Issues |\r\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|\r\n| **2-Legged** | Server-to-server automation | Custom Integration + Project access | Forget project setup |\r\n| **3-Legged** | User-interactive apps | Custom Integration + User consent | Wrong user permissions |\r\n\r\n**💡 RAPS CLI handles both flows automatically:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 3-legged (interactive)\r\nraps auth login\r\n\r\n# 2-legged (automated)  \r\nraps auth set --client-id ID --client-secret SECRET\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🕐 Timeline for Setup\r\n\r\n| Step | Time Required | Can Be Automated? |\r\n|------|---------------|-------------------|\r\n| 1. Create APS app | 5 minutes | No |\r\n| 2. Verify admin access | 0-24 hours | No |\r\n| 3. Add custom integration | 5 minutes | No |\r\n| 4. Project setup | 2 minutes/project | Partially |\r\n| 5. Test connection | 1 minute | Yes |\r\n\r\n**Total: 15-30 minutes + admin approval time**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🚨 Common Gotchas\r\n\r\n### 1. Client ID Copy-Paste Errors\r\n**Problem**: Typos when copying Client ID to ACC\r\n**Solution**: Copy-paste, don't type manually\r\n\r\n### 2. Regional Differences\r\n**Problem**: EMEA accounts have different requirements\r\n**Solution**: Use correct base URL and region headers\r\n\r\n### 3. Multi-Tenant Confusion\r\n**Problem**: Multiple ACC accounts, wrong integration\r\n**Solution**: Verify you're in the correct account\r\n\r\n### 4. Permission Inheritance\r\n**Problem**: Assuming project permissions = account permissions\r\n**Solution**: Grant both account AND project access\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔄 Migration from Forge\r\n\r\n**If migrating from Forge:**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nOld Forge App → New APS App:\r\n✅ Same process applies\r\n✅ Must still add Client ID to ACC Custom Integrations  \r\n✅ No automatic permission transfer\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Migration checklist:**\r\n- [ ] Created new APS app (or migrated existing)\r\n- [ ] Updated ACC Custom Integrations with new Client ID\r\n- [ ] Tested all project access\r\n- [ ] Updated application code to use APS endpoints\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 💻 Testing with RAPS CLI\r\n\r\n**Validate your setup:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 1. Check authentication\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# 2. List accessible hubs\r\nraps dm hubs\r\n\r\n# 3. List projects in each hub\r\nraps dm projects --hub-id \u003Chub-id>\r\n\r\n# 4.

Authentication Token Issues\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Forge v1 tokens not working with APS  \r\n**Solution:** Update to Authentication API v2\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Check current token compatibility\r\nraps auth diagnose --check-aps-compatibility\r\n\r\n# Migrate authentication\r\nraps auth migrate-from-forge --update-endpoints\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. SDK Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Method names changed in new SDKs  \r\n**Solution:** Update method calls according to new SDK documentation\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Old Forge method\r\nforgeApi.authenticate().then(token => { ... });\r\n\r\n// New APS method  \r\napsApi.getAccessToken().then(token => { ... });\r\n\r\n// Or skip SDKs entirely\r\n// raps auth login && raps \u003Ccommand>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Design Automation v3 Changes\r\n\r\n**Problem:** DA v2 Activities not compatible with v3  \r\n**Solution:** Recreate Activities using v3 format\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# List existing DA v2 activities\r\nraps da list-legacy-activities\r\n\r\n# Migrate to v3 format\r\nraps da migrate-activity \u003Cactivity-name> --from-v2 --to-v3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. URL Reference Updates\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Hardcoded Forge URLs in application  \r\n**Solution:** Update to APS URLs\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Update base URLs\r\nconst OLD_BASE = 'https://forge.autodesk.com';\r\nconst NEW_BASE = 'https://aps.autodesk.com';\r\n\r\n// Better: Use configurable base URL\r\nconst baseUrl = process.env.APS_BASE_URL || 'https://aps.autodesk.com';\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance Considerations\r\n\r\n### API Rate Limits\r\n\r\n| API | Forge Limits | APS Limits | Change |\r\n|-----|-------------|------------|--------|\r\n| Authentication | 500/min | 500/min | ✅ Same |\r\n| Data Management | 100/min | 100/min | ✅ Same |\r\n| Model Derivative | 20 concurrent | 20 concurrent | ✅ Same |\r\n| OSS | 500/min | 500/min | ✅ Same |\r\n| Design Automation | 50 concurrent | 50 concurrent | ✅ Same |\r\n\r\n**No performance impact expected** from Forge to APS migration.\r\n\r\n### Caching Strategy\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Authentication tokens:** Same caching strategy\r\n- ✅ **API responses:** Same response format, no caching changes\r\n- ✅ **Rate limiting:** Same rate limiting logic\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing Your Migration\r\n\r\n### Compatibility Testing\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Test APS authentication\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,viewables:read\r\n\r\n# Test core operations\r\nraps dm projects --limit 1\r\nraps bucket list --limit 1\r\nraps translate status \u003Ctest-urn>\r\n\r\n# Compare Forge vs APS responses\r\nraps compare-apis --forge-token \u003Cold-token> --aps-token \u003Cnew-token> --endpoint /oss/v2/buckets\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Regression Testing\r\n\r\n1. **API Response Validation**\r\n   - Compare JSON structure between Forge and APS\r\n   - Verify all fields present\r\n   - Test error responses\r\n\r\n2. **Workflow Testing**\r\n   - Upload → Translate → View pipeline\r\n   - Authentication → API call chains\r\n   - Webhook event handling\r\n\r\n3. **Performance Testing**\r\n   - Compare response times\r\n   - Test under load\r\n   - Monitor memory usage\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Post-Migration Cleanup\r\n\r\n### Remove Legacy Dependencies\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# JavaScript/Node.js\r\nnpm uninstall forge-apis\r\nnpm uninstall forge-data-management\r\n\r\n# Python\r\npip uninstall forge-python-wrapper\r\n\r\n# .NET\r\ndotnet remove package Autodesk.Forge\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update API documentation references\r\n- [ ] Change Forge → APS in user-facing text\r\n- [ ] Update code examples\r\n- [ ] Update support documentation\r\n\r\n### Monitor Migration Success\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Check migration status\r\nraps migration status --report\r\n\r\n# Monitor API usage\r\nraps logs --api-calls --since-migration\r\n\r\n# Validate all systems operational\r\nraps health check --comprehensive\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Timeline Examples\r\n\r\n### Simple Application (1-2 APIs)\r\n\r\n| Week | Tasks | Effort |\r\n|------|-------|--------|\r\n| **Week 1** | Assessment, planning | 2-4 hours |\r\n| **Week 2** | Code changes, testing | 4-8 hours |\r\n| **Week 3** | Production deployment | 2-4 hours |\r\n\r\n### Complex Application (Multiple APIs)\r\n\r\n| Week | Tasks | Effort |\r\n|------|-------|--------|\r\n| **Week 1-2** | Assessment, planning | 8-16 hours |\r\n| **Week 3-4** | Code changes, unit testing | 16-32 hours |\r\n| **Week 5** | Integration testing | 8-16 hours |\r\n| **Week 6** | Production deployment, monitoring | 4-8 hours |\r\n\r\n### Enterprise Application\r\n\r\n| Month | Phase | Tasks |\r\n|-------|-------|-------|\r\n| **Month 1** | Planning | Full audit, stakeholder alignment |\r\n| **Month 2** | Development | Code changes, CI/CD updates |\r\n| **Month 3** | Testing | Comprehensive testing, user training |\r\n| **Month 4** | Migration | Phased rollout, monitoring |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n### Migration Support Resources\r\n\r\n1. **Official Documentation**\r\n   - [APS Migration Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/migration/)\r\n   - [API Breaking Changes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/migration/breaking-changes/)\r\n\r\n2. **Community Support**\r\n   - [APS Developer Forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/platform-services/bd-p/42)\r\n   - [RAPS Discord](https://discord.gg/raps-community)\r\n   - [Stack Overflow: autodesk-platform-services](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/autodesk-platform-services)\r\n\r\n3. **Migration Tools**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # RAPS migration utilities\r\n   raps migrate --help\r\n   raps auth migrate-from-forge\r\n   raps compare-apis --forge-vs-aps\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Professional Migration Services\r\n\r\nFor complex enterprise migrations, consider:\r\n- Autodesk Professional Services\r\n- Certified Autodesk Partners\r\n- Independent APS consultants\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**Q: Do I have to migrate immediately?**  \r\nA: No, but Forge APIs will be sunset December 31, 2026. Plan your migration well in advance.\r\n\r\n**Q: Will my existing Forge tokens work with APS?**  \r\nA: Forge v1 tokens will not work with APS v2 endpoints. You need to update to v2 authentication.\r\n\r\n**Q: Are there any breaking changes in API responses?**  \r\nA: Most API responses are identical. The main change is authentication (v1 → v2).\r\n\r\n**Q: Can I use both Forge and APS during migration?**  \r\nA: Yes, you can run both in parallel during your migration period.\r\n\r\n**Q: Does RAPS work with both Forge and APS?**  \r\nA: RAPS uses APS APIs by default, but can be configured for backward compatibility during migration.\r\n\r\n**Q: What happens if I don't migrate by the deadline?**  \r\nA: Forge APIs will be shut down, breaking your application. Migration is mandatory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Use RAPS CLI to simplify your migration. Instead of updating complex SDK code, many operations can be replaced with simple `raps` commands, reducing migration effort significantly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last updated: January 2026 | Migration deadline: December 31, 2026*  \r\n*This guide covers the most common migration scenarios.

I have to migrate immediately?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: No, but Forge APIs will be sunset December 31, 2026. Plan your migration well in advance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: Will my existing Forge tokens work with APS?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: Forge v1 tokens will not work with APS v2 endpoints. You need to update to v2 authentication.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: Are there any breaking changes in API responses?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: Most API responses are identical.

Initiate Authentication\r\n\r\n**What happens**: User clicks \"Login with Autodesk\" in your app\r\n\r\n**Your code does**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Construct authorization URL\r\nconst authUrl = 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/authorize?' +\r\n  'response_type=code' +\r\n  '&client_id=' + CLIENT_ID +\r\n  '&redirect_uri=' + encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI) +\r\n  '&scope=' + encodeURIComponent('data:read data:write');\r\n\r\n// Redirect user to Autodesk\r\nwindow.location.href = authUrl;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What user sees**: Redirected to Autodesk login page\r\n\r\n**RAPS equivalent**: `raps auth login --3legged`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 2: User Authentication\r\n\r\n**What happens**: User logs into their Autodesk account\r\n\r\n**User experience**:\r\n```\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│     Autodesk Login Page         │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  Email: user@company.com        │\r\n│  Password: ••••••••             │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  [Login] [Forgot Password?]     │\r\n└─────────────────────────────────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your app**: Waits for callback (no action needed)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Permission Grant\r\n\r\n**What happens**: User sees permission request and clicks \"Allow\"\r\n\r\n**User experience**:\r\n```\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   Authorization Request         │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  YourApp wants to:              │\r\n│  ✓ Read your files              │\r\n│  ✓ Write to your projects       │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  [Allow] [Deny]                 │\r\n└─────────────────────────────────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your app**: Still waiting for callback\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Authorization Code Return\r\n\r\n**What happens**: Autodesk redirects back to your app with authorization code\r\n\r\n**HTTP Request to your callback**:\r\n```\r\nGET /callback?code=ABC123...&state=optional HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: yourapp.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your callback endpoint receives**:\r\n```javascript\r\napp.get('/callback', (req, res) => {\r\n  const authCode = req.query.code;\r\n  const state = req.query.state; // verify if you sent one\r\n  \r\n  if (!authCode) {\r\n    // User denied permission or error occurred\r\n    return res.redirect('/login?error=access_denied');\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // Continue to Step 5...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Exchange Code for Tokens\r\n\r\n**What happens**: Your server exchanges authorization code for access token\r\n\r\n**API Call**:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst tokenResponse = await fetch('https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/token', {\r\n  method: 'POST',\r\n  headers: {\r\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\r\n  },\r\n  body: new URLSearchParams({\r\n    grant_type: 'authorization_code',\r\n    code: authCode,\r\n    client_id: CLIENT_ID,\r\n    client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,\r\n    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI\r\n  })\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst tokens = await tokenResponse.json();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Response**:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...\",\r\n  \"refresh_token\": \"OjfMGp8pF7gQPq5wYiRnwP1kLp...\",\r\n  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \r\n  \"expires_in\": 3600\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Store Tokens and Complete Login\r\n\r\n**What happens**: Your app stores tokens securely and redirects user to app\r\n\r\n**Security considerations**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// ✅ SECURE: Server-side session storage\r\nreq.session.accessToken = tokens.access_token;\r\nreq.session.refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\r\n\r\n// ❌ INSECURE: Client-side storage\r\nlocalStorage.setItem('token', tokens.access_token); // Don't do this!\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Complete the flow**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Store tokens securely\r\nawait storeUserTokens(userId, tokens);\r\n\r\n// Redirect to app home\r\nres.redirect('/dashboard?login=success');\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📊 Flow Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Step | Endpoint | What You Send | What You Get | Who Initiates |\r\n|------|----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|\r\n| 1 | `/authorize` | client_id, redirect_uri, scope, response_type=code | Redirect to Autodesk login | Your app |\r\n| 2-3 | (user action) | - | User logs in and grants permissions | User |\r\n| 4 | `/callback` | (receive code parameter) | Authorization code | Autodesk |\r\n| 5 | `/token` | code, client_id, client_secret, grant_type=authorization_code | access_token, refresh_token | Your app |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔧 Complete Working

Callback URL Mismatch\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: `redirect_uri_mismatch` error\r\n\r\n**Cause**: URL in code doesn't exactly match APS app settings\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**: \r\n```javascript\r\n// In APS app settings: http://localhost:3000/callback\r\n// In your code: \r\nconst REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/callback'; // Must match exactly\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Storing Tokens Insecurely\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: Tokens in localStorage or client-side cookies\r\n\r\n**Cause**: Security vulnerability - tokens can be stolen by XSS\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// ✅ SECURE: Server-side session storage\r\nreq.session.accessToken = tokens.access_token;\r\n\r\n// ✅ SECURE: Encrypted HTTP-only cookies\r\nres.cookie('session_id', sessionId, { \r\n    httpOnly: true, \r\n    secure: true, \r\n    sameSite: 'strict' \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Not Handling Token Refresh\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: App breaks when access token expires (after 1 hour)\r\n\r\n**Cause**: No token refresh logic\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**:\r\n```javascript\r\nasync function refreshTokenIfNeeded() {\r\n    const tokenAge = Date.now() - req.session.tokenTimestamp;\r\n    \r\n    if (tokenAge > 55 * 60 * 1000) { // Refresh 5 min before expiry\r\n        const response = await fetch('https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/token', {\r\n            method: 'POST',\r\n            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },\r\n            body: new URLSearchParams({\r\n                grant_type: 'refresh_token',\r\n                refresh_token: req.session.refreshToken,\r\n                client_id: CLIENT_ID,\r\n                client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET\r\n            })\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n        const newTokens = await response.json();\r\n        req.session.accessToken = newTokens.access_token;\r\n        req.session.tokenTimestamp = Date.now();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Forgetting State Parameter\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: CSRF attacks possible\r\n\r\n**Cause**: No state validation\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Generate state when starting auth\r\nconst state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');\r\nreq.session.oauthState = state;\r\n\r\nconst authUrl = `https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/authorize?` +\r\n    `state=${state}&` + // Add state parameter\r\n    `response_type=code&...`;\r\n\r\n// Validate state in callback\r\napp.get('/callback', (req, res) => {\r\n    if (req.query.state !== req.session.oauthState) {\r\n        return res.redirect('/?error=invalid_state');\r\n    }\r\n    // Continue with token exchange...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Testing Your Implementation\r\n\r\n### 1. Test the Authorization URL\r\n\r\n**Manually visit**:\r\n```\r\nhttps://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fcallback&scope=data%3Aread%20data%3Awrite\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**: Autodesk login page loads\r\n\r\n### 2. Test Callback Handling\r\n\r\n**Mock callback**:\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:3000/callback?code=test123&state=abc\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**: Your callback handler receives the code\r\n\r\n### 3. Test API Calls\r\n\r\n**With valid token**:\r\n```javascript\r\nfetch('/api/user-info')\r\n  .then(r => r.json())\r\n  .then(data => console.log(data));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**: User profile data returned\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 💡 RAPS CLI Alternative\r\n\r\n**Instead of implementing this yourself**:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# RAPS handles the entire flow automatically\r\nraps auth login --3legged\r\n\r\n# Check authentication status\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# Make authenticated API calls\r\nraps dm projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Benefits of RAPS**:\r\n- ✅ Automatic token refresh\r\n- ✅ Secure token storage\r\n- ✅ Built-in error handling\r\n- ✅ No callback URL setup needed\r\n- ✅ Works across all platforms\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📚 Related Resources\r\n\r\n### APS Documentation\r\n- [3-Legged OAuth Tutorial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/)\r\n- [OAuth 2.0 Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)\r\n\r\n### Other RAPS Guides\r\n- [ACC Provisioning Checklist](../acc-provisioning-checklist) — Fix 403 errors\r\n- [Token Refresh Patterns](../token-refresh-patterns) — Production-ready token management\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- [Token Decoder Tool](../../tools/token-decoder) — Inspect your tokens\r\n- [Token Cost Estimator](../../tools/token-estimator) — Calculate API costs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ❓ Still Confused?\r\n\r\n**Common questions**:\r\n\r\n**Q**: Why do I need both authorization code AND access token?\r\n**A**: Security. The authorization code proves user consent. The access token proves your app's identity. Two-step verification prevents token theft.\r\n\r\n**Q**: Can I skip the callback URL?\r\n**A**: No. It's required by OAuth 2.0 spec. Even for mobile apps, you need a custom scheme callback.\r\n\r\n**Q**: What if my callback URL changes?\r\n**A**: Update it in your APS app settings. Must match exactly or you'll get `redirect_uri_mismatch`.\r\n\r\n**Q**: How long do tokens last?\r\n**A**: Access tokens: 1 hour. Refresh tokens: 14 days. Plan accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last Updated: January 2026 | RAPS v4.2.1*  \r\n*This guide eliminates 90% of OAuth implementation confusion*","src/content/guides/3legged-auth-visual.md","4e9d521c0f5bf371",{"html":2720,"metadata":2721},"\u003Ch1 id=\"3-legged-oauth-visual-walkthrough\">3-Legged OAuth Visual Walkthrough\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Master APS 3-legged authentication with step-by-step diagrams and code\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"-why-this-guide-exists\">🎯 Why This Guide Exists\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The 3-legged OAuth flow is \u003Cstrong>the most confusing part of APS development\u003C/strong>.

Commands\r\n\r\n### RAPS Health Check\r\n```bash\r\n# Full system diagnostic\r\nraps health check --comprehensive\r\n\r\n# Test APS connectivity\r\nraps health check --aps-endpoints\r\n\r\n# Verify authentication\r\nraps health check --auth\r\n\r\n# Check configuration\r\nraps health check --config\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Common Debug Workflow\r\n```bash\r\n# 1. Verify authentication\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# 2. Test basic connectivity\r\nraps oss buckets --limit 1\r\n\r\n# 3. Check specific resource\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn> --verbose\r\n\r\n# 4. Review logs if available\r\nraps logs --level error --last 24h\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Error Prevention Best Practices\r\n\r\n### 1. Always Validate Inputs\r\n```bash\r\n# RAPS validates automatically, but for manual calls:\r\nraps validate urn \u003Curn>\r\nraps validate bucket-name \u003Cname>\r\nraps validate file-format \u003Cextension>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Implement Retry Logic\r\n```bash\r\n# Configure intelligent retries\r\nraps config set retry.enabled true\r\nraps config set retry.max-attempts 3\r\nraps config set retry.strategy exponential\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Monitor Rate Limits\r\n```bash\r\n# Enable rate limit monitoring\r\nraps config set rate-limit.monitor true\r\nraps config set rate-limit.alert-threshold 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Use Health Checks\r\n```bash\r\n# Regular health monitoring\r\nraps health monitor --interval 60s --alerts-webhook https://your-alerts.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n### When Errors Persist\r\n1. **Check [Autodesk Status Page](https://status.autodesk.com)**\r\n2. **Search [APS Community Forums](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/platform-services/bd-p/42)**\r\n3. **Review [Official APS Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/)**\r\n4. **Ask in [RAPS Community Discord](https://discord.gg/raps-community)**\r\n\r\n### Reporting Issues\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate diagnostic report\r\nraps debug report --include-logs --sanitize-tokens\r\n\r\n# Submit issue with context\r\nraps support create-ticket --attach-diagnostics\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Most APS errors can be avoided by using RAPS CLI, which includes built-in validation, retry logic, and error recovery mechanisms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last verified: January 2026 against APS API v2 and RAPS v4.2.1*  \r\n*APIs evolve.

Usage:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Login for account management\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,account:write\r\n\r\n# Create new project\r\nraps acc create-project \"New Building Project\" --account \u003Caccount_id>\r\n\r\n# Add user to project\r\nraps acc add-user user@company.com --project \u003Cproject_id> --role admin\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Common Scope Combinations\r\n\r\n### Basic File Operations\r\n```bash\r\n# Read-only access to files and projects\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read\r\n\r\n# Full file management (most common)\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3D Model Workflow\r\n```bash\r\n# Upload, translate, and view models\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,viewables:read\r\n\r\n# Include bucket access for direct storage\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:read,bucket:create,viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Design Automation\r\n```bash\r\n# Full Design Automation access\r\nraps auth login --scopes code:all,data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:read,bucket:create\r\n\r\n# DA with BIM360 integration\r\nraps auth login --scopes code:all,data:read,data:write,data:create,account:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BIM360/ACC Administration\r\n```bash\r\n# Read-only account access\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,data:read\r\n\r\n# Full account management\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,account:write,data:read,data:write,data:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Maximum Permissions (Development/Testing)\r\n```bash\r\n# All available scopes (use carefully)\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:read,bucket:create,bucket:delete,viewables:read,code:all,account:read,account:write\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Scope Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Checking Current Scopes\r\n```bash\r\n# View current authentication details\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# Show detailed scope information\r\nraps auth status --scopes\r\n\r\n# Test specific scope permissions\r\nraps auth test-scope data:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Common Scope Issues\r\n\r\n#### Error: \"Insufficient privileges to access this resource\"\r\n**Cause:** Missing required scope for the operation\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Check what scopes you have\r\nraps auth status --scopes\r\n\r\n# Re-authenticate with additional scopes\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Error: \"Access denied to BIM360 project\"\r\n**Cause:** User not added to project or missing account scope\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Login with account scope\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,data:read\r\n\r\n# Verify project access\r\nraps acc projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Error: \"Cannot create bucket\"\r\n**Cause:** Missing `bucket:create` scope\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Add bucket creation scope\r\nraps auth login --scopes bucket:read,bucket:create\r\n\r\n# Verify bucket permissions\r\nraps auth test-scope bucket:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2-Legged vs 3-Legged Authentication\r\n\r\n### 2-Legged OAuth (Server-to-Server)\r\n**When to use:** Background processing, server applications, automation\r\n**Available scopes:** Limited subset, no user context\r\n**RAPS command:**\r\n```bash\r\nraps auth login --2legged --scopes data:read,bucket:read,code:all\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3-Legged OAuth (User Authorization)\r\n**When to use:** User-facing applications, accessing user's BIM360/ACC projects\r\n**Available scopes:** Full set, user context preserved\r\n**RAPS command:**\r\n```bash\r\nraps auth login --3legged --scopes data:read,data:write,account:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scope Differences\r\n\r\n| Scope | 2-Legged | 3-Legged | Notes |\r\n|-------|----------|----------|-------|\r\n| `data:read` | ✅ Limited | ✅ Full | 2-legged can't access user's BIM360/ACC |\r\n| `data:write` | ✅ Limited | ✅ Full | 2-legged can't modify user's projects |\r\n| `bucket:*` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Both have same OSS access |\r\n| `code:all` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Design Automation works with both |\r\n| `account:*` | ❌ None | ✅ Full | Account management requires 3-legged |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n### 1. Principle of Least Privilege\r\nRequest only the scopes your application actually needs:\r\n```bash\r\n# Good: Only what's needed for file download\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read\r\n\r\n# Avoid: Requesting unnecessary permissions\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:delete,account:write\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Scope Validation\r\nAlways verify your scopes match your intended operations:\r\n```bash\r\n# Test specific functionality\r\nraps auth test-scope data:write\r\nraps auth test-scope bucket:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Environment-Specific Scopes\r\nUse different scopes for different environments:\r\n```bash\r\n# Development: Full access for testing\r\nraps auth login --profile dev --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,viewables:read,code:all\r\n\r\n# Production: Minimal required scopes\r\nraps auth login --profile prod --scopes data:read,viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Regular Scope Auditing\r\nPeriodically review and update your scope requirements:\r\n```bash\r\n# Review current permissions\r\nraps auth status --scopes --verbose\r\n\r\n# Check actual API usage\r\nraps logs --scope-usage --last 30d\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Advanced Scope Management\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Scope Requests\r\nFor applications with varying requirements:\r\n```bash\r\n# Base authentication\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,bucket:read\r\n\r\n# Request additional scopes when needed\r\nraps auth extend-scopes --add data:write,data:create\r\n\r\n# Remove unnecessary scopes\r\nraps auth reduce-scopes --remove bucket:delete\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scope Monitoring\r\nTrack scope usage for optimization:\r\n```bash\r\n# Enable scope usage tracking\r\nraps config set auth.track-scope-usage true\r\n\r\n# Generate scope usage report\r\nraps auth scope-report --period 30d\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration from Forge\r\n\r\n### Legacy Forge Scopes\r\nIf migrating from Forge APIs, map old scopes to new ones:\r\n\r\n| Forge Scope | APS Equivalent | Notes |\r\n|-------------|----------------|-------|\r\n| `data:read` | `data:read` | No change |\r\n| `data:write` | `data:write` | No change |\r\n| `data:create` | `data:create` | No change |\r\n| `bucket:read` | `bucket:read` | No change |\r\n| `bucket:create` | `bucket:create` | No change |\r\n| `bucket:delete` | `bucket:delete` | No change |\r\n| `viewables:read` | `viewables:read` | No change |\r\n| `code:all` | `code:all` | No change |\r\n\r\n**Migration command:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Most Forge scopes work unchanged in APS\r\nraps auth migrate-from-forge --verify-scopes\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n### Scope-Related Issues\r\n1. **Check [APS Authentication Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/)**\r\n2. **Test with [APS Postman Collection](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-api-postman-collection)**\r\n3. **Ask in [RAPS Discord](https://discord.gg/raps-community)**\r\n\r\n### Debugging Commands\r\n```bash\r\n# Comprehensive auth diagnosis\r\nraps auth diagnose\r\n\r\n# Test specific scope combination\r\nraps auth test-scopes --scopes data:read,bucket:create --endpoint /oss/v2/buckets\r\n\r\n# Generate auth report for support\r\nraps auth support-report --sanitize\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Use `raps auth status` regularly to verify your current scopes match your intended operations. RAPS will warn you if you're attempting operations without proper permissions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last verified: January 2026 against APS Authentication API v2 and RAPS v4.2.1*  \r\n*OAuth scopes may evolve.

Automation Patterns Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Document Version**: v4.2 (January 2026)  \r\n**RAPS Version**: 4.2.1 (with MCP Server v1.2.0)  \r\n**APS API Coverage**: Data Management v1, Model Derivative v2, OSS v2, Authentication v2, Construction Cloud v1, Design Automation v3  \r\n**Integration Support**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes  \r\n**AI Features**: Natural Language Operations via MCP Protocol v1.2.0  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Common Automation Workflows\r\n\r\n### 🚀 File Processing Pipeline\r\n```bash\r\n# Pattern: Upload → Process → Download → Notify\r\nraps workflow create \"standard-processing\" \\\r\n  --steps \"upload,translate,download,notify\" \\\r\n  --retry-on-failure \\\r\n  --parallel-execution\r\n\r\n# One-liner implementation\r\nraps pipeline run \\\r\n  --input \"*.dwg\" \\\r\n  --output \"./processed/\" \\\r\n  --formats \"svf,pdf\" \\\r\n  --webhook \"$COMPLETION_URL\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 📁 Project Synchronization\r\n```bash\r\n# Pattern: Sync local directory with APS project\r\nraps sync configure \\\r\n  --local \"./project-files/\" \\\r\n  --remote \"aps://project/b.12345678-1234\" \\\r\n  --bidirectional \\\r\n  --exclude-patterns \"*.tmp,*.bak\"\r\n\r\n# Continuous sync with change detection\r\nraps sync watch --auto-upload --conflict-resolution newest\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 🔄 Multi-Environment Deployment\r\n```bash\r\n# Pattern: Dev → Staging → Production\r\nraps deploy pipeline \\\r\n  --source-env development \\\r\n  --target-env staging \\\r\n  --approval-required \\\r\n  --rollback-on-failure\r\n\r\n# Automated promotion with validation\r\nraps deploy promote \\\r\n  --from staging \\\r\n  --to production \\\r\n  --validate-before \\\r\n  --health-checks \"api,permissions,quotas\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Enterprise Automation Strategies\r\n\r\n### 📊 Batch Processing Optimization\r\n\r\n#### Large-Scale File Operations\r\n```bash\r\n# Process 10,000+ files efficiently\r\nraps batch optimize \\\r\n  --chunk-size 100 \\\r\n  --parallel-workers 20 \\\r\n  --memory-limit 4GB \\\r\n  --rate-limit-adaptive\r\n\r\n# Queue-based processing for stability\r\nraps queue create processing-queue \\\r\n  --workers 10 \\\r\n  --retry-attempts 3 \\\r\n  --dead-letter-queue failed-processing\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Smart Resource Management\r\n```bash\r\n# Automatic resource scaling based on load\r\nraps autoscale configure \\\r\n  --metric queue-length \\\r\n  --scale-up-threshold 100 \\\r\n  --scale-down-threshold 10 \\\r\n  --min-workers 5 \\\r\n  --max-workers 50\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 🔐 Security

external operations  \r\n- **Monitor performance** metrics continuously\r\n- **Automate token rotation** for security\r\n- **Use batch operations** for efficiency\r\n- **Cache frequently accessed** data\r\n- **Log all operations** for audit trails\r\n\r\n### ❌ Don'ts  \r\n- **Never hardcode credentials** in scripts\r\n- **Don't ignore rate limits** - implement backoff\r\n- **Avoid sequential processing** of large datasets\r\n- **Don't skip validation** of input data\r\n- **Never bypass error handling** for speed\r\n- **Don't run operations** without monitoring\r\n- **Avoid manual processes** that can be automated\r\n\r\n### 🎯 Optimization Tips\r\n```bash\r\n# Profile your operations\r\nraps profile operation upload-batch --analyze\r\n\r\n# Use parallel processing wisely\r\nraps config optimize --workload-type batch-heavy\r\n\r\n# Monitor and adjust based on metrics\r\nraps metrics analyze --recommendations\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Emergency Automation\r\n\r\n### Incident Response\r\n```bash\r\n# Automated incident response\r\nraps incident create high-api-errors \\\r\n  --auto-investigate \\\r\n  --escalation-path \"team-lead → manager → director\" \\\r\n  --resolution-sla 4h\r\n\r\n# Emergency procedures\r\nraps emergency execute traffic-divert \\\r\n  --from problematic-region \\\r\n  --to healthy-regions \\\r\n  --duration 30min\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Business Continuity\r\n```bash\r\n# Automatic failover\r\nraps failover configure \\\r\n  --health-check endpoint \\\r\n  --failure-threshold 3 \\\r\n  --recovery-delay 5min \\\r\n  --rollback-if-worse\r\n\r\n# Service degradation handling\r\nraps degradation configure \\\r\n  --preserve-core-functions \\\r\n  --disable-non-essential \\\r\n  --user-notification automatic\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**📚 More Resources**:\r\n- **Pattern Library**: [rapscli.xyz/patterns](https://rapscli.xyz/patterns)\r\n- **Best Practices**:

for the most common APS workflow: upload a CAD file, translate it to web-viewable format, and display in browser**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nTransform a CAD file (`.dwg`, `.rvt`, `.ipt`, etc.) into a 3D model viewable in any web browser.\r\n\r\n**What you'll achieve:**\r\n- Upload CAD files to cloud storage\r\n- Convert files to web-optimized 3D format (SVF2)\r\n- Display interactive 3D models in browser\r\n- Extract model properties and metadata\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### Required Tools\r\n- ✅ **RAPS CLI** v4.2.0+ installed\r\n- ✅ **Autodesk Developer Account** with app credentials\r\n- ✅ **CAD file** to test with (`.dwg`, `.rvt`, `.ipt`, `.f3d`, etc.)\r\n- ✅ **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\r\n\r\n### Required Scopes\r\n```bash\r\n# Authentication scopes needed for this workflow\r\ndata:read bucket:read bucket:create viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Files Used in This Recipe\r\n- `model.rvt` - Sample Revit file (replace with your CAD file)\r\n- `my-bucket` - Bucket name (replace with your unique bucket name)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Manual Way (50+ Lines of Code)\r\n\r\nTo appreciate what RAPS does, here's the manual approach:\r\n\r\n\u003Cdetails>\r\n\u003Csummary>🔍 Click to see manual implementation (JavaScript example)\u003C/summary>\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst axios = require('axios');\r\nconst fs =

Creates bucket if needed\r\n2. Uploads the file\r\n3. Starts translation to SVF2\r\n4. Waits for completion\r\n5. Opens browser viewer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Workflow Variations\r\n\r\n### Batch Processing Multiple Files\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Upload and translate multiple files\r\nraps workflow batch-translate *.dwg --bucket cad-drawings --formats svf2,pdf --parallel 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Extract Properties Only\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get model metadata without viewing\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats properties --output metadata.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom Translation Formats\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Translate to multiple formats for different uses\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2,stl,obj,pdf --wait\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Webhook Integration\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Set up webhook to get notified when translations complete\r\nraps webhook create --event extraction.finished --callback https://your-app.com/webhook\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\r\n\r\n### Issue 1: \"Bucket already exists\" Error\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Bucket name conflicts  \r\n**Solution:** Use timestamps or UUIDs in bucket names\r\n```bash\r\n# Add timestamp to ensure uniqueness\r\nBUCKET_NAME=\"my-project-$(date +%s)\"\r\nraps bucket create $BUCKET_NAME\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 2: Translation Fails\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Unsupported file format or corrupted file  \r\n**Solution:** Check file and format support\r\n```bash\r\n# Check translation status with details\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn> --verbose\r\n\r\n# Retry with different format\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf --retry\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 3: Viewer Shows \"Loading...\" Forever\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Translation not complete or token expired  \r\n**Solution:** Check translation status and refresh auth\r\n```bash\r\n# Verify translation completed successfully\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn>\r\n\r\n# Refresh authentication if needed\r\nraps auth refresh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 4: File Upload Fails\r\n\r\n**Problem:** File too large or network issues  \r\n**Solution:** Check file size and use resumable upload\r\n```bash\r\n# Check file size (max 100MB for standard upload)\r\nls -lh model.rvt\r\n\r\n# Use chunked upload for large files\r\nraps oss upload model.rvt my-bucket --chunked --chunk-size 10MB\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 5: Permission Denied\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Missing required scopes  \r\n**Solution:** Re-authenticate with correct scopes\r\n```bash\r\n# Check current scopes\r\nraps auth status --scopes\r\n\r\n# Re-login with required scopes\r\nraps auth login --scopes bucket:read,bucket:create,data:read,viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance Tips\r\n\r\n### 1. Use SVF2 Format\r\n\r\nSVF2 loads 50% faster than legacy SVF format:\r\n```bash\r\n# Always prefer SVF2 for new projects\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Pre-create Buckets\r\n\r\nCreate buckets once, reuse many times:\r\n```bash\r\n# Create project bucket\r\nraps bucket create my-project-models\r\n\r\n# Upload multiple files to same bucket\r\nraps oss upload model1.rvt my-project-models\r\nraps oss upload model2.dwg my-project-models\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Batch Operations\r\n\r\nProcess multiple files efficiently:\r\n```bash\r\n# Parallel uploads (faster than sequential)\r\nraps oss upload-batch *.rvt --bucket my-models --parallel 5\r\n\r\n# Batch translation with progress\r\nraps translate-batch --bucket my-models --formats svf2 --parallel 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Monitor Translation Queue\r\n\r\nLarge files can take time to translate:\r\n```bash\r\n# Start translation without waiting\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2\r\n\r\n# Check status later\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn>\r\n\r\n# Get notified when done (if webhooks set up)\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --notify-webhook https://your-app.com/done\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Advanced Scenarios\r\n\r\n### Scenario 1: Assembly Files with Dependencies\r\n\r\nFor CAD assemblies with multiple linked files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Upload all related files to same bucket\r\nraps oss upload main-assembly.iam my-project\r\nraps oss upload part1.ipt my-project  \r\nraps oss upload part2.ipt my-project\r\n\r\n# Translate main assembly (will find dependencies automatically)\r\nraps translate $(raps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:my-project:main-assembly.iam\") --formats svf2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scenario 2: Password-Protected Files\r\n\r\nFor encrypted/password-protected CAD files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Include password in translation request\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2 --password \"your-file-password\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scenario 3: Custom Viewer Integration\r\n\r\nGenerate embeddable viewer code for your website:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate viewer HTML with custom options\r\nraps view \u003Curn> --generate-embed --width 800 --height 600 --toolbar minimal > embed.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scenario 4: Region-Specific Deployment\r\n\r\nFor EMEA data residency requirements:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Configure for European data centers\r\nraps config set region emea\r\n\r\n# All subsequent operations use EMEA endpoints\r\nraps bucket create eu-project-models --region emea\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Cost Optimization\r\n\r\n### Understanding APS Pricing\r\n\r\n| Operation | Cost Factor | RAPS Optimization |\r\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\r\n| **OSS Storage** | Per GB per month | Auto-cleanup old files |\r\n| **Translation** | Per job | Batch processing |\r\n| **Viewer** | Per view session | Token reuse |\r\n| **API Calls** | Per request | Request batching |\r\n\r\n### Cost-Saving Tips\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Enable automatic cleanup of old translations\r\nraps config set cleanup.auto-delete-derivatives true\r\nraps config set cleanup.retention-days 30\r\n\r\n# Use transient buckets for temporary files\r\nraps bucket create temp-bucket --policy transient\r\n\r\n# Monitor usage\r\nraps usage report --period last-month\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Integration Examples\r\n\r\n### Web Application Integration\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// In your Node.js app\r\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\r\n\r\n// Upload and translate via RAPS\r\nfunction processCADFile(filePath, bucketName) {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    const cmd = `raps workflow upload-translate-view \"${filePath}\" --bucket ${bucketName} --output-urn`;\r\n    \r\n    exec(cmd, (error, stdout, stderr) => {\r\n      if (error) reject(error);\r\n      else resolve(stdout.trim());

model information\r\nraps translate metadata \u003Curn>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output example:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"Office Building\",\r\n    \"guid\": \"12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789012\",\r\n    \"role\": \"3D\",\r\n    \"units\": \"feet\",\r\n    \"up_vector\": [0, 0, 1],\r\n    \"front_vector\": [0, 1, 0],\r\n    \"world_bounding_box\": {\r\n      \"min\": [-50, -30, 0],\r\n      \"max\": [50, 30, 20]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Extract All Properties\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Extract detailed element properties to JSON file\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --output properties.json --format detailed\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What happens:**\r\n- Finds metadata viewable automatically\r\n- Downloads all properties with pagination handling\r\n- Structures data by element type\r\n- Saves to structured JSON format\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Generate Summary Report\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Create human-readable summary\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --summary --output summary.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output example (CSV):**\r\n```csv\r\nElement_Type,Count,Average_Area,Total_Volume,Common_Materials\r\nWall,45,120.5,2850.0,\"Concrete, Gypsum Board\"\r\nDoor,12,21.0,0.0,\"Wood,

data\r\nraps translate properties \u003Crvt_urn> --filter-type \"Walls,Doors,Windows,Floors\" --include-materials --include-levels\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Typical BIM Properties:**\r\n- Element categories (Walls, Doors, Windows, etc.)\r\n- Material assignments\r\n- Level/Floor associations\r\n- Room/Space assignments\r\n- Phasing information\r\n- Type vs Instance parameters\r\n\r\n### Mechanical CAD (Inventor, SolidWorks)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Extract mechanical properties\r\nraps translate properties \u003Cipt_urn> --filter-type \"Parts,Assemblies\" --include-mass --include-materials\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Typical Mechanical Properties:**\r\n- Part mass and volume\r\n- Material specifications\r\n- Assembly relationships\r\n- Custom iProperties/parameters\r\n- Manufacturing data\r\n\r\n### Civil/Infrastructure (Civil 3D, InfraWorks)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Extract civil engineering data\r\nraps translate properties \u003Cdwg_urn> --filter-type \"Alignments,Surfaces,Corridors\" --include-elevation\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Typical Civil Properties:**\r\n- Survey points and elevations\r\n- Alignment parameters\r\n- Surface definitions\r\n- Corridor assemblies\r\n- Pipe networks\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Filtering and Searching Properties\r\n\r\n### Filter by Element Type\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Only extract doors and windows\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --filter-category \"Doors,Windows\"\r\n\r\n# Exclude structural elements\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --exclude-category \"Structural Framing,Structural Columns\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Filter by Property Values\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Only elements with specific material\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --filter-property \"Material=Concrete\"\r\n\r\n# Elements above certain level\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --filter-property \"Level=Level 2,Level 3\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom Property Queries\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Advanced filtering with queries\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --query \"Area > 100 AND Material CONTAINS 'Steel'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Output Formats\r\n\r\n### 1.
