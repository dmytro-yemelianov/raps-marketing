Not because you did anything wrong, but because SDK versioning in the CAD world follows the \"break everything annually\" philosophy.\r\n\r\n### SOLIDWORKS: The Interop DLL Nightmare Champion\r\n\r\nSOLIDWORKS takes the crown for version compatibility disasters. Here's what developers face:\r\n\r\n**The Annual Breaking Change Ritual**\r\n- Every major version breaks interop DLLs\r\n- Add-ins must be rebuilt for each release\r\n- Running multiple SOLIDWORKS versions? Prepare for path management hell\r\n\r\n**Real Error Messages That Haunt Developers:**\r\n```\r\nError CS1705 Assembly 'AngelSix.SolidDna' uses \r\n'SolidWorks.Interop.swpublished, Version=26.0.1.1' \r\nwhich has a higher version than the referenced assembly\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The VBA 7.1 Apocalypse**\r\nSOLIDWORKS 2021 SP2 introduced VBA 7.1, instantly breaking every existing macro:\r\n- Earlier Installation Managers don't recognize VBA 7.1 components\r\n- Macros written pre-2021 simply stop working\r\n- No backward compatibility\r\n- No migration tools\r\n\r\n### PTC Creo: Visual Studio Dependency Roulette\r\n\r\nCreo Toolkit adds its own special flavor of version hell:\r\n- Must recompile for **each Creo version**\r\n- Toolkit libraries have Visual Studio version dependencies\r\n- \"Always forward compatible but never backward\"\r\n- The GCRI plugin for backward compatibility? Dropped at Creo 7\r\n\r\nOne developer's summary: \"If you're on Creo 8, you can't open Creo 9 files. Period.\"\r\n\r\n### Siemens NX: The Six-Month Breaking Change Cycle\r\n\r\nWhile others break annually, NX innovates with **six-month functional releases**:\r\n- \"NX Open functionality may change\"\r\n- \"New prerequisites may be needed\"\r\n- Critical bugs require community-maintained patches\r\n- GitHub repos exist specifically to fix Teamcenter 12.2 SOA crashes\r\n\r\n### The Hidden Costs\r\n\r\n**Developer Time Tax**\r\n- 2-3 weeks annually rebuilding for new versions\r\n- Testing across multiple versions\r\n- Maintaining separate codebases\r\n- Documentation updates for version-specific quirks\r\n\r\n**Enterprise Deployment Nightmares**\r\n- Can't upgrade until all add-ins are rebuilt\r\n- Different departments on different versions\r\n- Integration failures between version-mismatched systems\r\n- Testing matrix grows exponentially\r\n\r\n### The IModelDoc2 Interface: 700+ Members of Confusion\r\n\r\nSOLIDWORKS's `IModelDoc2` perfectly exemplifies the problem:\r\n- Over 700 members split across extension objects\r\n- \"No real logic in the separation\"\r\n- Documentation doesn't mention the split\r\n- Version changes shuffle members randomly\r\n\r\n### Why This Validates RAPS's Approach\r\n\r\nRAPS's architecture anticipates version conflicts:\r\n- Workspace crates allow version-specific implementations\r\n- Plugin system enables version-specific handlers\r\n- CLI abstraction shields users from API changes\r\n- Single binary works across multiple APS versions\r\n\r\n### The Market Reality\r\n\r\n| Platform | Breaking Change Frequency | Developer Impact |\r\n|----------|---------------------------|------------------|\r\n| SOLIDWORKS | Annual (100% breaking) | Rebuild everything |\r\n| Creo | Per major version | Full recompilation |\r\n| NX Open | 6 months | Continuous updates |\r\n| Revit/APS | Annual (partial) | Selective updates |\r\n\r\n### The Billion-Dollar Opportunity\r\n\r\nConsider the math:\r\n- 100,000+ CAD API developers globally\r\n- 2-3 weeks annually on version updates\r\n- $150/hour average developer cost\r\n- = **$600M+ in annual version compatibility costs**\r\n\r\nA tool that abstracts version differences could capture significant value from this waste.\r\n\r\n### Competitive Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Worst Offenders:**\r\n1. SOLIDWORKS - Complete interop breaks annually\r\n2. NX Open - Fastest breaking change cycle (6 months)\r\n3. Creo - No backward compatibility by design\r\n\r\n**Best (Least Worst):**\r\n- Onshape - REST API provides more stability\r\n- Cloud platforms - Can version endpoints separately\r\n\r\n### The Path Forward\r\n\r\nVersion compatibility tools should:\r\n1. Detect SDK/interop mismatches before runtime\r\n2. Provide compatibility matrices\r\n3. Suggest specific version combinations\r\n4. Abstract API changes behind stable interfaces\r\n5. Maintain backward compatibility layers\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\n\r\nOur next article dives into documentation disasters—where Windchill developers beg for \"Hello World\" examples, and NX documentation isn't even installed by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Part of our \"Cross-Platform Developer Pain Points\" series.

updates breaking compatibility\r\n- **Mitigation**: Active participation in MCP development, early access to protocol changes\r\n- **Contingency**: Rapid update releases, backwards compatibility layers\r\n\r\n#### **AI Assistant Integration Issues**\r\n- **Risk**: Specific AI tools changing their MCP implementation\r\n- **Mitigation**: Support multiple AI assistants, maintain reference implementations\r\n- **Contingency**: Quick pivot to alternative assistants, community-driven compatibility fixes\r\n\r\n### **Market Risks**\r\n\r\n#### **Competing AI Integrations**\r\n- **Risk**: Autodesk or competitors launching AI-powered APS tools\r\n- **Mitigation**: First-mover advantage, open source community, superior integration\r\n- **Contingency**: Emphasize open source benefits, community-driven development, ecosystem approach\r\n\r\n#### **Low Adoption of AI Assistants**\r\n- **Risk**: Target audience not ready for AI-augmented workflows\r\n- **Mitigation**: Education campaign, gradual adoption pathway, traditional CLI remains available\r\n- **Contingency**: Focus on early adopter segments, B2B enterprise sales approach\r\n\r\n### **Execution Risks**\r\n\r\n#### **Resource Constraints**\r\n- **Risk**: Single-person execution limiting campaign reach\r\n- **Mitigation**: Community involvement, automated tools, strategic partnerships\r\n- **Contingency**: Focus on highest-impact activities, delegate content creation to community\r\n\r\n#### **Technical Quality Issues**\r\n- **Risk**: Bugs or performance issues during high-visibility launch\r\n- **Mitigation**: Extensive beta testing, performance monitoring, rapid response team\r\n- **Contingency**: Immediate fixes, transparent communication, compensation for affected users\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Post-Launch Strategy (2 Months)\r\n\r\n### **Month 1: Optimization and Expansion**\r\n\r\n#### **Feature Enhancement Based on Feedback**\r\n- [ ] **User Experience

Here's the streamlined approach:\r\n\r\n**Quick Setup:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Set your credentials once\r\nexport APS_CLIENT_ID=\"your_client_id\"\r\nexport APS_CLIENT_SECRET=\"your_client_secret\"\r\n\r\n# Test the connection\r\nraps auth test\r\n✓ 2-legged authentication successful\r\n\r\n# For 3-legged workflows\r\nraps auth login\r\n# Opens browser, handles full OAuth flow\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why this approach works better:**\r\n✅ Automatic token refresh handling\r\n✅ Built-in retry logic for network issues\r\n✅ Proper error messages vs. cryptic HTTP codes\r\n✅ Works consistently across environments\r\n\r\n**Full authentication guide**: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/auth\r\n\r\nThe manual token management you're wrestling with becomes a non-issue when the tool handles it properly.

Here's how to handle it properly:\r\n\r\n**Your Current Approach Issues:**\r\n- Manual polling every X seconds wastes API calls\r\n- No exponential backoff leads to rate limiting\r\n- Hard to handle multiple translations simultaneously\r\n- Error states often go unhandled\r\n\r\n**RAPS Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Simple case - translate and wait\r\nraps translate start $URN --format svf2 --wait\r\n# Handles all polling automatically, returns when complete\r\n\r\n# Batch case - multiple files\r\nraps translate batch *.rvt --format svf2 --parallel=4\r\n# Optimizes API calls, handles failures gracefully\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What RAPS does behind the scenes:**\r\n✅ Intelligent polling intervals (starts fast, backs off)\r\n✅ Parallel translation tracking\r\n✅ Automatic retry on transient failures\r\n✅ Progress reporting and status updates\r\n\r\n**For custom polling logic**: Check the source code at [GitHub link] - the polling algorithm is well-documented and you can adapt the pattern.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/translation\r\n\r\nHope this saves you the debugging time! Translation workflows are tricky to get right.\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Dmytro Yemelianov | Built RAPS to solve exactly these automation challenges*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Template Category 2: Educational + RAPS Context**\r\n\r\n#### **General APS Architecture Questions**\r\n```markdown\r\nGreat architecture question! Let me break down how [APS concept] works and then show you a practical implementation.\r\n\r\n**Understanding [APS Concept]:**\r\n[2-3 paragraphs of educational content explaining the concept thoroughly]\r\n\r\n**Implementation Considerations:**\r\nWhen implementing this in production, you'll want to consider:\r\n- Error handling and retry logic\r\n- Rate limiting and API quotas  \r\n- Authentication token management\r\n- Monitoring and observability\r\n\r\n**Practical Implementation:**\r\nWhile you can certainly build this from scratch using the raw APIs, there's significant complexity in handling edge cases properly. Here's how RAPS approaches it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[RAPS commands that demonstrate the concept]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why the abstraction helps:**\r\n- Handles the 80% of edge cases you haven't thought of yet\r\n- Battle-tested retry logic and error handling\r\n- Consistent behavior across different APS services\r\n- Built-in monitoring and logging capabilities\r\n\r\n**Learning Resources:**\r\n- Official APS docs: [link]\r\n- RAPS implementation: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/[relevant-section]\r\n- Example workflows: [GitHub examples link]\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask follow-up questions about any part of this!\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Dmytro Yemelianov | Expert Elite | Helping teams automate APS workflows*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Template Category 3: Troubleshooting + RAPS Alternative**\r\n\r\n#### **Complex Technical Debugging**\r\n```markdown\r\nI see several potential issues in your approach. Let me help debug this step by step:\r\n\r\n**Immediate Issues to Fix:**\r\n1. [Specific technical issue 1 with solution]\r\n2. [Specific technical issue 2 with solution]\r\n3. [Specific technical issue 3 with solution]\r\n\r\n**Code Review:**\r\nLooking at your example, here are the problems:\r\n```[language]\r\n// Your code with comments explaining issues\r\n[user's code with inline comments about problems]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Corrected Approach:**\r\n```[language]\r\n// Fixed version with explanations\r\n[corrected code with explanations]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**However, this highlights a broader pattern...**\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the kind of complexity that leads teams to adopt automation tools. You're reinventing error handling, retry logic, and authentication management - which is time-consuming and error-prone.\r\n\r\n**Alternative Approach with RAPS:**\r\n```bash\r\n# The same workflow, but tool handles complexity\r\n[RAPS commands that accomplish the same goal]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why this matters:**\r\n- Your time is better spent on business logic than infrastructure plumbing\r\n- Production systems need robust error handling (which is hard to get right)\r\n- Automation tools handle edge cases you haven't encountered yet\r\n- Team knowledge transfer becomes easier with standardized approaches\r\n\r\n**Both paths are valid** - if you want to build it yourself, the corrections above should help. If you want to focus on higher-value work, the automation approach might save weeks of debugging.\r\n\r\nLet me know which direction makes sense for your project!\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Dmytro Yemelianov | I've debugged these patterns hundreds of times*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Template Category 4: Advanced Enterprise Topics**\r\n\r\n#### **Enterprise Architecture Questions**\r\n```markdown\r\nExcellent question about enterprise-scale [topic]! This gets into some sophisticated deployment patterns.\r\n\r\n**Technical Architecture:**\r\n[Detailed technical explanation demonstrating deep expertise]\r\n\r\n**Enterprise Considerations:**\r\nWhen deploying this at enterprise scale, you'll also need to think about:\r\n- Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)\r\n- Credential management and rotation\r\n- Audit logging and compliance requirements\r\n- Monitoring and alerting for failures\r\n- Team access control and permissions\r\n\r\n**Production-Ready Implementation:**\r\nHere's how to architect this properly for enterprise use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Enterprise deployment example\r\nraps config profile create production\r\nraps config set --profile production audit_level \"full\"\r\nraps config set --profile production encryption_required true\r\n\r\n# Pipeline execution with full observability\r\nraps pipeline run enterprise-workflow.yaml \\\r\n  --audit-log /var/log/aps-operations \\\r\n  --telemetry-enabled \\\r\n  --retry-policy exponential\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Enterprise Features:**\r\n✅ Multi-tenant profile management\r\n✅ OpenTelemetry integration for monitoring\r\n✅ Comprehensive audit trails for compliance\r\n✅ Built-in encryption and security controls\r\n✅ Zero-downtime deployment patterns\r\n\r\n**Architecture Deep Dive:**\r\nFor the full enterprise architecture patterns, see: https://rapscli.xyz/docs/enterprise\r\n\r\n**Personal Experience:**\r\nI've implemented similar patterns at several large AEC firms.

to view 3D models in my web application\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Model Derivative API** → Convert files to web-viewable formats\r\n- **Viewer SDK** → Display models in browser\r\n- **Object Storage Service** → Store original files\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: 5+ API calls, complex geometry handling\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps auth login\r\nraps oss upload model.rvt mybucket\r\nraps translate $(raps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:mybucket:model.rvt\") --wait\r\nraps view $(raps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:mybucket:model.rvt\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth (server apps) or 3-legged (user apps)  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `data:read`, `viewables:read`, `bucket:read`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. 📁 BIM 360/ACC File Management\r\n\r\n**\"I need to access files from BIM 360 or Autodesk Construction Cloud projects\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Data Management API** → Access project files and folders\r\n- **Authentication API** → User authorization (3-legged OAuth)\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Complex hub/project hierarchy navigation\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps auth login --3legged --scopes account:read,data:read\r\nraps dm projects\r\nraps dm folders \u003Cproject-id>\r\nraps dm download \u003Citem-id> ./local-file.rvt\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 3-legged OAuth (user must have project access)  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `account:read`, `data:read`, `data:write` (if uploading)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. 🔄 Batch File Processing\r\n\r\n**\"I need to convert hundreds of CAD files to different formats\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Object Storage Service** → Upload source files\r\n- **Model Derivative API** → Batch translation jobs\r\n- **Webhooks** (optional) → Get notified when translations complete\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Complex job queuing, polling, error handling\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps bucket create batch-processing\r\nraps oss upload-batch *.dwg --bucket batch-processing\r\nraps translate-batch --bucket batch-processing --formats pdf,svf2 --parallel 5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `bucket:create`, `bucket:read`, `data:read`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. 🤖 CAD Automation & Scripting\r\n\r\n**\"I want to automate repetitive tasks in AutoCAD/Revit/Inventor\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Design Automation API** → Run scripts on cloud-hosted CAD engines\r\n- **Object Storage Service** → Input/output file storage\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Complex AppBundle/Activity setup, WorkItem management\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps da engines --filter autocad\r\nraps da create-activity MyDrawingProcessor --engine Autodesk.AutoCAD+24\r\nraps da submit-workitem MyDrawingProcessor --input drawing.dwg --script process.scr\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `code:all`, `bucket:read`, `bucket:create`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5. 📊 Model Data Extraction\r\n\r\n**\"I need to extract properties, geometry, or metadata from CAD models\"**\r\n\r\n**APIs Needed:**\r\n- **Model Derivative API** → Extract properties and metadata\r\n- **Object Storage Service** or **Data Management** → Source file access\r\n\r\n**Typical Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual approach: Multi-step manifest navigation, GUID handling\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats properties\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --output properties.json\r\nraps translate metadata \u003Curn> --guid \u003Cmodel-guid>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Authentication:** 2-legged OAuth  \r\n**Key Scopes:** `data:read`, `viewables:read`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## API Comparison Matrix\r\n\r\n| Use Case | Primary API | Secondary APIs | RAPS Commands | Authentication Type

|\r\n|--------|----------|----------|--------------|\r\n| **US** | `developer.api.autodesk.com` | North America, default | `raps config set region us` |\r\n| **EMEA** | `developer.api.autodesk.com` | Europe, Middle East, Africa | `raps config set region emea` |\r\n\r\n**Note:** Most APS APIs are globally distributed, but some services (like OSS buckets) have regional preferences for performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n### Once You Know Your API\r\n\r\n1. **Set Up Authentication**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   raps auth login --scopes \u003Crequired-scopes>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Test Basic Connectivity**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   raps auth status\r\n   raps \u003Capi-command> --help\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Start with RAPS Examples**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   raps examples \u003Capi-name>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Review Detailed Documentation**\r\n   - [APS Developer Portal](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/)\r\n   - [RAPS CLI Documentation](https://rapscli.xyz/docs/)\r\n\r\n### Still Not Sure?\r\n\r\n**Common Combinations:**\r\n- **Simple file viewer:** OSS + Model Derivative + Viewer SDK\r\n- **BIM 360 integration:** Data Management + Model Derivative\r\n- **Batch processing:** OSS + Design Automation\r\n- **Full construction workflow:** All APIs\r\n\r\n**Get Help:**\r\n- [APS Community Forums](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/platform-services/bd-p/42)\r\n- [RAPS Discord Community](https://discord.gg/raps-community)\r\n- [RAPS GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dmytro-yemelianov/raps/discussions)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with RAPS CLI to prototype your workflow quickly. Once you understand the API flow, you can always implement the same logic directly using HTTP requests or SDKs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last verified: January 2026 | RAPS v4.2.1 | APS APIs: Auth v2, DM v1, MD v2, OSS v2, DA v3*  \r\n*This decision tree covers 90% of APS use cases.

You're not alone. \r\n\r\n**The root cause**: Developers don't realize they must manually enable custom integrations from the ACC admin console. This isn't mentioned in most tutorials, causing hours of frustration.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Quick Fix\r\n\r\n**If you're getting 403 errors, skip to Step 3** — that's usually the missing piece.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Create APS Application\r\n\r\n**✅ Prerequisites:**\r\n- [ ] Autodesk account with developer access\r\n- [ ] Access to [aps.autodesk.com](https://aps.autodesk.com)\r\n\r\n**✅ App Creation:**\r\n- [ ] Logged into APS Developer Portal\r\n- [ ] Created new application\r\n- [ ] Noted **Client ID** (you'll need this exact value)\r\n- [ ] Noted **Client Secret** (keep secure!)\r\n- [ ] Set **Callback URL** correctly:\r\n  - Development: `http://localhost:3000/callback`\r\n  - Production: Your actual domain\r\n- [ ] Selected required **API access**:\r\n  - ✅ Data Management API\r\n  - ✅ Model Derivative API\r\n  - ✅ Any other APIs you need\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Verify ACC Admin Access\r\n\r\n**✅ Account Requirements:**\r\n- [ ] You are an **Account Admin** in ACC/BIM360 (not just Project Admin)\r\n- [ ] Your ACC subscription is active\r\n- [ ] You can access Account Administration settings\r\n\r\n**❌ If you're NOT an Account Admin:**\r\n```\r\nContact your ACC Account Admin and ask them to:\r\n1.

Authentication Token Issues\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Forge v1 tokens not working with APS  \r\n**Solution:** Update to Authentication API v2\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Check current token compatibility\r\nraps auth diagnose --check-aps-compatibility\r\n\r\n# Migrate authentication\r\nraps auth migrate-from-forge --update-endpoints\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. SDK Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Method names changed in new SDKs  \r\n**Solution:** Update method calls according to new SDK documentation\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Old Forge method\r\nforgeApi.authenticate().then(token => { ... });\r\n\r\n// New APS method  \r\napsApi.getAccessToken().then(token => { ... });\r\n\r\n// Or skip SDKs entirely\r\n// raps auth login && raps \u003Ccommand>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Design Automation v3 Changes\r\n\r\n**Problem:** DA v2 Activities not compatible with v3  \r\n**Solution:** Recreate Activities using v3 format\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# List existing DA v2 activities\r\nraps da list-legacy-activities\r\n\r\n# Migrate to v3 format\r\nraps da migrate-activity \u003Cactivity-name> --from-v2 --to-v3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. URL Reference Updates\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Hardcoded Forge URLs in application  \r\n**Solution:** Update to APS URLs\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Update base URLs\r\nconst OLD_BASE = 'https://forge.autodesk.com';\r\nconst NEW_BASE = 'https://aps.autodesk.com';\r\n\r\n// Better: Use configurable base URL\r\nconst baseUrl = process.env.APS_BASE_URL || 'https://aps.autodesk.com';\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance Considerations\r\n\r\n### API Rate Limits\r\n\r\n| API | Forge Limits | APS Limits | Change |\r\n|-----|-------------|------------|--------|\r\n| Authentication | 500/min | 500/min | ✅ Same |\r\n| Data Management | 100/min | 100/min | ✅ Same |\r\n| Model Derivative | 20 concurrent | 20 concurrent | ✅ Same |\r\n| OSS | 500/min | 500/min | ✅ Same |\r\n| Design Automation | 50 concurrent | 50 concurrent | ✅ Same |\r\n\r\n**No performance impact expected** from Forge to APS migration.\r\n\r\n### Caching Strategy\r\n\r\n- ✅ **Authentication tokens:** Same caching strategy\r\n- ✅ **API responses:** Same response format, no caching changes\r\n- ✅ **Rate limiting:** Same rate limiting logic\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing Your Migration\r\n\r\n### Compatibility Testing\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Test APS authentication\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,viewables:read\r\n\r\n# Test core operations\r\nraps dm projects --limit 1\r\nraps bucket list --limit 1\r\nraps translate status \u003Ctest-urn>\r\n\r\n# Compare Forge vs APS responses\r\nraps compare-apis --forge-token \u003Cold-token> --aps-token \u003Cnew-token> --endpoint /oss/v2/buckets\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Regression Testing\r\n\r\n1. **API Response Validation**\r\n   - Compare JSON structure between Forge and APS\r\n   - Verify all fields present\r\n   - Test error responses\r\n\r\n2. **Workflow Testing**\r\n   - Upload → Translate → View pipeline\r\n   - Authentication → API call chains\r\n   - Webhook event handling\r\n\r\n3. **Performance Testing**\r\n   - Compare response times\r\n   - Test under load\r\n   - Monitor memory usage\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Post-Migration Cleanup\r\n\r\n### Remove Legacy Dependencies\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# JavaScript/Node.js\r\nnpm uninstall forge-apis\r\nnpm uninstall forge-data-management\r\n\r\n# Python\r\npip uninstall forge-python-wrapper\r\n\r\n# .NET\r\ndotnet remove package Autodesk.Forge\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update API documentation references\r\n- [ ] Change Forge → APS in user-facing text\r\n- [ ] Update code examples\r\n- [ ] Update support documentation\r\n\r\n### Monitor Migration Success\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Check migration status\r\nraps migration status --report\r\n\r\n# Monitor API usage\r\nraps logs --api-calls --since-migration\r\n\r\n# Validate all systems operational\r\nraps health check --comprehensive\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Timeline Examples\r\n\r\n### Simple Application (1-2 APIs)\r\n\r\n| Week | Tasks | Effort |\r\n|------|-------|--------|\r\n| **Week 1** | Assessment, planning | 2-4 hours |\r\n| **Week 2** | Code changes, testing | 4-8 hours |\r\n| **Week 3** | Production deployment | 2-4 hours |\r\n\r\n### Complex Application (Multiple APIs)\r\n\r\n| Week | Tasks | Effort |\r\n|------|-------|--------|\r\n| **Week 1-2** | Assessment, planning | 8-16 hours |\r\n| **Week 3-4** | Code changes, unit testing | 16-32 hours |\r\n| **Week 5** | Integration testing | 8-16 hours |\r\n| **Week 6** | Production deployment, monitoring | 4-8 hours |\r\n\r\n### Enterprise Application\r\n\r\n| Month | Phase | Tasks |\r\n|-------|-------|-------|\r\n| **Month 1** | Planning | Full audit, stakeholder alignment |\r\n| **Month 2** | Development | Code changes, CI/CD updates |\r\n| **Month 3** | Testing | Comprehensive testing, user training |\r\n| **Month 4** | Migration | Phased rollout, monitoring |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n### Migration Support Resources\r\n\r\n1. **Official Documentation**\r\n   - [APS Migration Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/migration/)\r\n   - [API Breaking Changes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/migration/breaking-changes/)\r\n\r\n2. **Community Support**\r\n   - [APS Developer Forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/platform-services/bd-p/42)\r\n   - [RAPS Discord](https://discord.gg/raps-community)\r\n   - [Stack Overflow: autodesk-platform-services](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/autodesk-platform-services)\r\n\r\n3. **Migration Tools**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # RAPS migration utilities\r\n   raps migrate --help\r\n   raps auth migrate-from-forge\r\n   raps compare-apis --forge-vs-aps\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Professional Migration Services\r\n\r\nFor complex enterprise migrations, consider:\r\n- Autodesk Professional Services\r\n- Certified Autodesk Partners\r\n- Independent APS consultants\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**Q: Do I have to migrate immediately?**  \r\nA: No, but Forge APIs will be sunset December 31, 2026. Plan your migration well in advance.\r\n\r\n**Q: Will my existing Forge tokens work with APS?**  \r\nA: Forge v1 tokens will not work with APS v2 endpoints. You need to update to v2 authentication.\r\n\r\n**Q: Are there any breaking changes in API responses?**  \r\nA: Most API responses are identical. The main change is authentication (v1 → v2).\r\n\r\n**Q: Can I use both Forge and APS during migration?**  \r\nA: Yes, you can run both in parallel during your migration period.\r\n\r\n**Q: Does RAPS work with both Forge and APS?**  \r\nA: RAPS uses APS APIs by default, but can be configured for backward compatibility during migration.\r\n\r\n**Q: What happens if I don't migrate by the deadline?**  \r\nA: Forge APIs will be shut down, breaking your application. Migration is mandatory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Use RAPS CLI to simplify your migration. Instead of updating complex SDK code, many operations can be replaced with simple `raps` commands, reducing migration effort significantly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last updated: January 2026 | Migration deadline: December 31, 2026*  \r\n*This guide covers the most common migration scenarios.

I have to migrate immediately?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: No, but Forge APIs will be sunset December 31, 2026. Plan your migration well in advance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: Will my existing Forge tokens work with APS?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: Forge v1 tokens will not work with APS v2 endpoints. You need to update to v2 authentication.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: Are there any breaking changes in API responses?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: Most API responses are identical. The main change is authentication (v1 → v2).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: Can I use both Forge and APS during migration?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: Yes, you can run both in parallel during your migration period.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: Does RAPS work with both Forge and APS?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: RAPS uses APS APIs by default, but can be configured for backward compatibility during migration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Q: What happens if I don’t migrate by the deadline?\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nA: Forge APIs will be shut down, breaking your application.

Initiate Authentication\r\n\r\n**What happens**: User clicks \"Login with Autodesk\" in your app\r\n\r\n**Your code does**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Construct authorization URL\r\nconst authUrl = 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/authorize?' +\r\n  'response_type=code' +\r\n  '&client_id=' + CLIENT_ID +\r\n  '&redirect_uri=' + encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI) +\r\n  '&scope=' + encodeURIComponent('data:read data:write');\r\n\r\n// Redirect user to Autodesk\r\nwindow.location.href = authUrl;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What user sees**: Redirected to Autodesk login page\r\n\r\n**RAPS equivalent**: `raps auth login --3legged`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 2: User Authentication\r\n\r\n**What happens**: User logs into their Autodesk account\r\n\r\n**User experience**:\r\n```\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│     Autodesk Login Page         │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  Email: user@company.com        │\r\n│  Password: ••••••••             │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  [Login] [Forgot Password?]     │\r\n└─────────────────────────────────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your app**: Waits for callback (no action needed)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Permission Grant\r\n\r\n**What happens**: User sees permission request and clicks \"Allow\"\r\n\r\n**User experience**:\r\n```\r\n┌─────────────────────────────────┐\r\n│   Authorization Request         │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  YourApp wants to:              │\r\n│  ✓ Read your files              │\r\n│  ✓ Write to your projects       │\r\n│                                 │\r\n│  [Allow] [Deny]                 │\r\n└─────────────────────────────────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your app**: Still waiting for callback\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Authorization Code Return\r\n\r\n**What happens**: Autodesk redirects back to your app with authorization code\r\n\r\n**HTTP Request to your callback**:\r\n```\r\nGET /callback?code=ABC123...&state=optional HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: yourapp.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your callback endpoint receives**:\r\n```javascript\r\napp.get('/callback', (req, res) => {\r\n  const authCode = req.query.code;\r\n  const state = req.query.state; // verify if you sent one\r\n  \r\n  if (!authCode) {\r\n    // User denied permission or error occurred\r\n    return res.redirect('/login?error=access_denied');\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // Continue to Step 5...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Exchange Code for Tokens\r\n\r\n**What happens**: Your server exchanges authorization code for access token\r\n\r\n**API Call**:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst tokenResponse = await fetch('https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/token', {\r\n  method: 'POST',\r\n  headers: {\r\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\r\n  },\r\n  body: new URLSearchParams({\r\n    grant_type: 'authorization_code',\r\n    code: authCode,\r\n    client_id: CLIENT_ID,\r\n    client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,\r\n    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI\r\n  })\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst tokens = await tokenResponse.json();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Response**:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...\",\r\n  \"refresh_token\": \"OjfMGp8pF7gQPq5wYiRnwP1kLp...\",\r\n  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \r\n  \"expires_in\": 3600\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Store Tokens and Complete Login\r\n\r\n**What happens**: Your app stores tokens securely and redirects user to app\r\n\r\n**Security considerations**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// ✅ SECURE: Server-side session storage\r\nreq.session.accessToken = tokens.access_token;\r\nreq.session.refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\r\n\r\n// ❌ INSECURE: Client-side storage\r\nlocalStorage.setItem('token', tokens.access_token); // Don't do this!\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Complete the flow**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Store tokens securely\r\nawait storeUserTokens(userId, tokens);\r\n\r\n// Redirect to app home\r\nres.redirect('/dashboard?login=success');\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📊 Flow Summary Table\r\n\r\n| Step | Endpoint | What You Send | What You Get | Who Initiates |\r\n|------|----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|\r\n| 1 | `/authorize` | client_id, redirect_uri, scope, response_type=code | Redirect to Autodesk login | Your app |\r\n| 2-3 | (user action) | - | User logs in and grants permissions | User |\r\n| 4 | `/callback` | (receive code parameter) | Authorization code | Autodesk |\r\n| 5 | `/token` | code, client_id, client_secret, grant_type=authorization_code | access_token, refresh_token | Your app |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔧 Complete Working

Callback URL Mismatch\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: `redirect_uri_mismatch` error\r\n\r\n**Cause**: URL in code doesn't exactly match APS app settings\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**: \r\n```javascript\r\n// In APS app settings: http://localhost:3000/callback\r\n// In your code: \r\nconst REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/callback'; // Must match exactly\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Storing Tokens Insecurely\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: Tokens in localStorage or client-side cookies\r\n\r\n**Cause**: Security vulnerability - tokens can be stolen by XSS\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// ✅ SECURE: Server-side session storage\r\nreq.session.accessToken = tokens.access_token;\r\n\r\n// ✅ SECURE: Encrypted HTTP-only cookies\r\nres.cookie('session_id', sessionId, { \r\n    httpOnly: true, \r\n    secure: true, \r\n    sameSite: 'strict' \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Not Handling Token Refresh\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: App breaks when access token expires (after 1 hour)\r\n\r\n**Cause**: No token refresh logic\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**:\r\n```javascript\r\nasync function refreshTokenIfNeeded() {\r\n    const tokenAge = Date.now() - req.session.tokenTimestamp;\r\n    \r\n    if (tokenAge > 55 * 60 * 1000) { // Refresh 5 min before expiry\r\n        const response = await fetch('https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/token', {\r\n            method: 'POST',\r\n            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },\r\n            body: new URLSearchParams({\r\n                grant_type: 'refresh_token',\r\n                refresh_token: req.session.refreshToken,\r\n                client_id: CLIENT_ID,\r\n                client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET\r\n            })\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n        const newTokens = await response.json();\r\n        req.session.accessToken = newTokens.access_token;\r\n        req.session.tokenTimestamp = Date.now();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Forgetting State Parameter\r\n\r\n**❌ Problem**: CSRF attacks possible\r\n\r\n**Cause**: No state validation\r\n\r\n**✅ Solution**:\r\n```javascript\r\n// Generate state when starting auth\r\nconst state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');\r\nreq.session.oauthState = state;\r\n\r\nconst authUrl = `https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/authorize?` +\r\n    `state=${state}&` + // Add state parameter\r\n    `response_type=code&...`;\r\n\r\n// Validate state in callback\r\napp.get('/callback', (req, res) => {\r\n    if (req.query.state !== req.session.oauthState) {\r\n        return res.redirect('/?error=invalid_state');\r\n    }\r\n    // Continue with token exchange...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Testing Your Implementation\r\n\r\n### 1. Test the Authorization URL\r\n\r\n**Manually visit**:\r\n```\r\nhttps://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fcallback&scope=data%3Aread%20data%3Awrite\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**: Autodesk login page loads\r\n\r\n### 2. Test Callback Handling\r\n\r\n**Mock callback**:\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:3000/callback?code=test123&state=abc\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**: Your callback handler receives the code\r\n\r\n### 3. Test API Calls\r\n\r\n**With valid token**:\r\n```javascript\r\nfetch('/api/user-info')\r\n  .then(r => r.json())\r\n  .then(data => console.log(data));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**: User profile data returned\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 💡 RAPS CLI Alternative\r\n\r\n**Instead of implementing this yourself**:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# RAPS handles the entire flow automatically\r\nraps auth login --3legged\r\n\r\n# Check authentication status\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# Make authenticated API calls\r\nraps dm projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Benefits of RAPS**:\r\n- ✅ Automatic token refresh\r\n- ✅ Secure token storage\r\n- ✅ Built-in error handling\r\n- ✅ No callback URL setup needed\r\n- ✅ Works across all platforms\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📚 Related Resources\r\n\r\n### APS Documentation\r\n- [3-Legged OAuth Tutorial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/)\r\n- [OAuth 2.0 Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)\r\n\r\n### Other RAPS Guides\r\n- [ACC Provisioning Checklist](../acc-provisioning-checklist) — Fix 403 errors\r\n- [Token Refresh Patterns](../token-refresh-patterns) — Production-ready token management\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- [Token Decoder Tool](../../tools/token-decoder) — Inspect your tokens\r\n- [Token Cost Estimator](../../tools/token-estimator) — Calculate API costs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ❓ Still Confused?\r\n\r\n**Common questions**:\r\n\r\n**Q**: Why do I need both authorization code AND access token?\r\n**A**: Security. The authorization code proves user consent. The access token proves your app's identity. Two-step verification prevents token theft.\r\n\r\n**Q**: Can I skip the callback URL?\r\n**A**: No. It's required by OAuth 2.0 spec. Even for mobile apps, you need a custom scheme callback.\r\n\r\n**Q**: What if my callback URL changes?\r\n**A**: Update it in your APS app settings. Must match exactly or you'll get `redirect_uri_mismatch`.\r\n\r\n**Q**: How long do tokens last?\r\n**A**: Access tokens: 1 hour. Refresh tokens: 14 days. Plan accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last Updated: January 2026 | RAPS v4.2.1*  \r\n*This guide eliminates 90% of OAuth implementation confusion*","src/content/guides/3legged-auth-visual.md","4e9d521c0f5bf371",{"html":2840,"metadata":2841},"\u003Ch1 id=\"3-legged-oauth-visual-walkthrough\">3-Legged OAuth Visual Walkthrough\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Master APS 3-legged authentication with step-by-step diagrams and code\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"-why-this-guide-exists\">🎯 Why This Guide Exists\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The 3-legged OAuth flow is \u003Cstrong>the most confusing part of APS development\u003C/strong>.

Services (APS) and Forge API errors with practical solutions**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Authentication Errors (401/403)\r\n\r\n### 401 Unauthorized\r\n\r\n| Context | Likely Cause | Manual Solution | RAPS Solution |\r\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|\r\n| **All APIs** | Token missing/invalid | Check Authorization header format | `raps auth status` to verify |\r\n| **All APIs** | Token expired | Get new token via auth flow | `raps auth refresh` |\r\n| **All APIs** | Malformed token | Verify Bearer prefix and token format | `raps auth login` validates automatically |\r\n\r\n**Example Error:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"developerMessage\": \"The request requires user authentication\",\r\n  \"errorCode\": \"AUTH-001\",\r\n  \"more info\": \"https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Quick Fix with RAPS:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Check current auth status\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# Refresh if expired\r\nraps auth refresh\r\n\r\n# Re-authenticate if needed\r\nraps auth login\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 403 Forbidden\r\n\r\n| Context | Likely Cause | Manual Solution | RAPS Solution |\r\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|\r\n| **Data Management** | Insufficient scopes | Add `data:read` or `data:write` to app | `raps auth status` shows current scopes |\r\n| **BIM360/ACC** | No project access | User must be added to project | `raps acc projects` lists accessible projects |\r\n| **OSS** | Wrong bucket permissions | Check bucket policy and ownership | `raps bucket list` shows accessible buckets |\r\n| **Model Derivative** | Source file access denied | Verify file permissions in Data Management | `raps translate status \u003Curn>` shows detailed errors |\r\n\r\n**Example Error:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"developerMessage\": \"Insufficient privileges to access this resource\",\r\n  \"errorCode\": \"FORBIDDEN\", \r\n  \"more info\": \"https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v1/overview/scopes\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Request Format Errors (400)\r\n\r\n### 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n| API Context | Common Causes | Manual Diagnosis | RAPS Prevention |\r\n|-------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|\r\n| **All APIs** | Invalid JSON syntax | Validate JSON with linter | RAPS validates all payloads |\r\n| **Model Derivative** | URN not base64-encoded | Use base64url encoding | `raps urn encode \u003Cinput>` |\r\n| **Model Derivative** | Invalid output format | Check supported format list | `raps translate --formats` shows options |\r\n| **Data Management** | Invalid folder/item hierarchy | Verify parent relationships | `raps dm folders \u003Cproject>` shows structure |\r\n| **OSS** | Invalid bucket name | Check naming conventions | `raps bucket create` validates names |\r\n\r\n**URN Encoding Example:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Manual (error-prone):\r\necho -n \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:bucket/file.dwg\" | base64 | tr '+/' '-_'\r\n\r\n# With RAPS:\r\nraps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:bucket/file.dwg\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Resource Not Found (404)\r\n\r\n### 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n| API Context | Likely Cause | Investigation Steps | RAPS Debugging |\r\n|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|\r\n| **Model Derivative** | URN doesn't exist or wrong encoding | Check OSS bucket contents first | `raps oss list \u003Cbucket>` then `raps urn encode` |\r\n| **Data Management** | Project/folder/item deleted | Verify in web interface | `raps dm projects` and `raps dm folders` |\r\n| **OSS** | Bucket or object deleted | List bucket contents | `raps bucket list` and `raps oss list \u003Cbucket>` |\r\n| **Design Automation** | Activity/AppBundle not found | Check DA console | `raps da activities` and `raps da appbundles` |\r\n\r\n**Debugging Workflow:**\r\n```bash\r\n# 1. Check if file exists in OSS\r\nraps oss list mybucket\r\n\r\n# 2. Verify URN encoding\r\nraps urn encode \"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:mybucket/model.rvt\"\r\n\r\n# 3. Check translation status\r\nraps translate status \u003Cencoded_urn>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Conflict Errors (409)\r\n\r\n### 409 Conflict\r\n\r\n| API Context | Specific Issue | Manual Resolution | RAPS Resolution |\r\n|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\r\n| **OSS** | Bucket already exists | Choose different name or use existing | `raps bucket list` first, then create |\r\n| **Data Management** | Version/item conflict | Check existing versions | `raps dm versions \u003Citem-id>` |\r\n| **Design Automation** | Activity/AppBundle name conflict | Use versioning or different name | `raps da create --increment-version` |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rate Limiting (429)\r\n\r\n### 429 Too Many Requests\r\n\r\n| API | Standard Limits | Backoff Strategy | RAPS Handling |\r\n|-----|-----------------|------------------|---------------|\r\n| **Authentication** | 500/min | Exponential backoff (2^n seconds) | Built-in rate limiting |\r\n| **Data Management** | 100/min | Linear backoff (1s increments) | Automatic queuing |\r\n| **Model Derivative** | 20 concurrent translations | Queue locally | `raps translate --parallel \u003Cn>` |\r\n| **OSS** | 500/min | Exponential backoff | Smart batching |\r\n| **Design Automation** | 50 concurrent WorkItems | Queue and monitor | Automatic WorkItem management |\r\n\r\n**Rate Limit Headers:**\r\n```\r\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 100\r\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 45\r\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200\r\n```\r\n\r\n**RAPS Rate Limit Management:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Configure rate limits\r\nraps config set rate-limit.enabled true\r\nraps config set rate-limit.requests-per-minute 80\r\n\r\n# Check current rate limit status\r\nraps auth status --rate-limits\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Server Errors (500/503)\r\n\r\n### 500 Internal Server Error\r\n\r\n| When It Happens | Likely Cause | Action Required | RAPS Response |\r\n|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|\r\n| **Translation jobs** | Service overload or file corruption | Retry after delay | Automatic retry with exponential backoff |\r\n| **File uploads** | Network interruption or service issue | Retry with same URN | Resumable upload support |\r\n| **Any API** | Autodesk infrastructure issue | Check [status.autodesk.com](https://status.autodesk.com) | Configurable retry policies |\r\n\r\n### 503 Service Unavailable\r\n\r\nUsually indicates planned maintenance or unplanned service disruption.\r\n\r\n**RAPS Resilience:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Configure robust retry policy\r\nraps config set retry.max-attempts 5\r\nraps config set retry.strategy exponential\r\nraps config set retry.max-delay 300s\r\n\r\n# Monitor service health\r\nraps health check --aps-services\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Model Derivative Specific Errors\r\n\r\n### Translation Failed\r\n\r\n**Common Manifest Error Messages:**\r\n\r\n| Error Message | Cause | Solution |\r\n|---------------|-------|----------|\r\n| \"Unsupported file format\" | File extension not recognized | Check [supported formats](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/supported-translations/) |\r\n| \"File is empty or corrupted\" | Upload corrupted or incomplete | Re-upload source file |\r\n| \"Missing dependencies\" | Assembly references missing | Upload all dependency files |\r\n| \"Invalid password\" | Encrypted file, wrong password | Provide correct password in translate request |\r\n| \"File too large\" | Exceeds size limits | Split file or use Design Automation |\r\n\r\n**Translation Debugging:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Check translation status with details\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn> --verbose\r\n\r\n# Get full manifest with error details\r\nraps translate manifest \u003Curn> --errors-only\r\n\r\n# Retry translation with different options\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2 --retry\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Design Automation Specific Errors\r\n\r\n### WorkItem Failures\r\n\r\n| Status | Description | Common Cause | RAPS Investigation |\r\n|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|\r\n| **failedLimitDataSize** | Output too large | Reduce output or increase limits | `raps da workitem logs \u003Cid>` |\r\n| **failedLimitProcessingTime** | Timeout exceeded | Optimize script or increase timeout | `raps da workitem details \u003Cid>` |\r\n| **failedDownload** | Input download failed | Check input URLs and permissions | `raps da workitem retry \u003Cid>` |\r\n| **failedInstructions** | Script execution failed | Debug script locally first | `raps da workitem logs \u003Cid> --detailed` |\r\n\r\n**Design

authentication\r\nraps health check --auth\r\n\r\n# Check configuration\r\nraps health check --config\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Common Debug Workflow\r\n```bash\r\n# 1. Verify authentication\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# 2. Test basic connectivity\r\nraps oss buckets --limit 1\r\n\r\n# 3. Check specific resource\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn> --verbose\r\n\r\n# 4. Review logs if available\r\nraps logs --level error --last 24h\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Error Prevention Best Practices\r\n\r\n### 1. Always Validate Inputs\r\n```bash\r\n# RAPS validates automatically, but for manual calls:\r\nraps validate urn \u003Curn>\r\nraps validate bucket-name \u003Cname>\r\nraps validate file-format \u003Cextension>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Implement Retry Logic\r\n```bash\r\n# Configure intelligent retries\r\nraps config set retry.enabled true\r\nraps config set retry.max-attempts 3\r\nraps config set retry.strategy exponential\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Monitor Rate Limits\r\n```bash\r\n# Enable rate limit monitoring\r\nraps config set rate-limit.monitor true\r\nraps config set rate-limit.alert-threshold 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Use Health Checks\r\n```bash\r\n# Regular health monitoring\r\nraps health monitor --interval 60s --alerts-webhook https://your-alerts.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n### When Errors Persist\r\n1. **Check [Autodesk Status Page](https://status.autodesk.com)**\r\n2. **Search [APS Community Forums](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/platform-services/bd-p/42)**\r\n3. **Review [Official APS Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/)**\r\n4. **Ask in [RAPS Community Discord](https://discord.gg/raps-community)**\r\n\r\n### Reporting Issues\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate diagnostic report\r\nraps debug report --include-logs --sanitize-tokens\r\n\r\n# Submit issue with context\r\nraps support create-ticket --attach-diagnostics\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Most APS errors can be avoided by using RAPS CLI, which includes built-in validation, retry logic, and error recovery mechanisms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last verified: January 2026 against APS API v2 and RAPS v4.2.1*  \r\n*APIs evolve.

File Operations\r\n```bash\r\n# Read-only access to files and projects\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read\r\n\r\n# Full file management (most common)\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3D Model Workflow\r\n```bash\r\n# Upload, translate, and view models\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,viewables:read\r\n\r\n# Include bucket access for direct storage\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:read,bucket:create,viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Design Automation\r\n```bash\r\n# Full Design Automation access\r\nraps auth login --scopes code:all,data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:read,bucket:create\r\n\r\n# DA with BIM360 integration\r\nraps auth login --scopes code:all,data:read,data:write,data:create,account:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BIM360/ACC Administration\r\n```bash\r\n# Read-only account access\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,data:read\r\n\r\n# Full account management\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,account:write,data:read,data:write,data:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Maximum Permissions (Development/Testing)\r\n```bash\r\n# All available scopes (use carefully)\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:read,bucket:create,bucket:delete,viewables:read,code:all,account:read,account:write\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Scope Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Checking Current Scopes\r\n```bash\r\n# View current authentication details\r\nraps auth status\r\n\r\n# Show detailed scope information\r\nraps auth status --scopes\r\n\r\n# Test specific scope permissions\r\nraps auth test-scope data:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Common Scope Issues\r\n\r\n#### Error: \"Insufficient privileges to access this resource\"\r\n**Cause:** Missing required scope for the operation\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Check what scopes you have\r\nraps auth status --scopes\r\n\r\n# Re-authenticate with additional scopes\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Error: \"Access denied to BIM360 project\"\r\n**Cause:** User not added to project or missing account scope\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Login with account scope\r\nraps auth login --scopes account:read,data:read\r\n\r\n# Verify project access\r\nraps acc projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Error: \"Cannot create bucket\"\r\n**Cause:** Missing `bucket:create` scope\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Add bucket creation scope\r\nraps auth login --scopes bucket:read,bucket:create\r\n\r\n# Verify bucket permissions\r\nraps auth test-scope bucket:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2-Legged vs 3-Legged Authentication\r\n\r\n### 2-Legged OAuth (Server-to-Server)\r\n**When to use:** Background processing, server applications, automation\r\n**Available scopes:** Limited subset, no user context\r\n**RAPS command:**\r\n```bash\r\nraps auth login --2legged --scopes data:read,bucket:read,code:all\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3-Legged OAuth (User Authorization)\r\n**When to use:** User-facing applications, accessing user's BIM360/ACC projects\r\n**Available scopes:** Full set, user context preserved\r\n**RAPS command:**\r\n```bash\r\nraps auth login --3legged --scopes data:read,data:write,account:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scope Differences\r\n\r\n| Scope | 2-Legged | 3-Legged | Notes |\r\n|-------|----------|----------|-------|\r\n| `data:read` | ✅ Limited | ✅ Full | 2-legged can't access user's BIM360/ACC |\r\n| `data:write` | ✅ Limited | ✅ Full | 2-legged can't modify user's projects |\r\n| `bucket:*` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Both have same OSS access |\r\n| `code:all` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Design Automation works with both |\r\n| `account:*` | ❌ None | ✅ Full | Account management requires 3-legged |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n### 1. Principle of Least Privilege\r\nRequest only the scopes your application actually needs:\r\n```bash\r\n# Good: Only what's needed for file download\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read\r\n\r\n# Avoid: Requesting unnecessary permissions\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,bucket:delete,account:write\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Scope Validation\r\nAlways verify your scopes match your intended operations:\r\n```bash\r\n# Test specific functionality\r\nraps auth test-scope data:write\r\nraps auth test-scope bucket:create\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Environment-Specific Scopes\r\nUse different scopes for different environments:\r\n```bash\r\n# Development: Full access for testing\r\nraps auth login --profile dev --scopes data:read,data:write,data:create,viewables:read,code:all\r\n\r\n# Production: Minimal required scopes\r\nraps auth login --profile prod --scopes data:read,viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Regular Scope Auditing\r\nPeriodically review and update your scope requirements:\r\n```bash\r\n# Review current permissions\r\nraps auth status --scopes --verbose\r\n\r\n# Check actual API usage\r\nraps logs --scope-usage --last 30d\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Advanced Scope Management\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Scope Requests\r\nFor applications with varying requirements:\r\n```bash\r\n# Base authentication\r\nraps auth login --scopes data:read,bucket:read\r\n\r\n# Request additional scopes when needed\r\nraps auth extend-scopes --add data:write,data:create\r\n\r\n# Remove unnecessary scopes\r\nraps auth reduce-scopes --remove bucket:delete\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scope Monitoring\r\nTrack scope usage for optimization:\r\n```bash\r\n# Enable scope usage tracking\r\nraps config set auth.track-scope-usage true\r\n\r\n# Generate scope usage report\r\nraps auth scope-report --period 30d\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration from Forge\r\n\r\n### Legacy Forge Scopes\r\nIf migrating from Forge APIs, map old scopes to new ones:\r\n\r\n| Forge Scope | APS Equivalent | Notes |\r\n|-------------|----------------|-------|\r\n| `data:read` | `data:read` | No change |\r\n| `data:write` | `data:write` | No change |\r\n| `data:create` | `data:create` | No change |\r\n| `bucket:read` | `bucket:read` | No change |\r\n| `bucket:create` | `bucket:create` | No change |\r\n| `bucket:delete` | `bucket:delete` | No change |\r\n| `viewables:read` | `viewables:read` | No change |\r\n| `code:all` | `code:all` | No change |\r\n\r\n**Migration command:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Most Forge scopes work unchanged in APS\r\nraps auth migrate-from-forge --verify-scopes\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n### Scope-Related Issues\r\n1. **Check [APS Authentication Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/)**\r\n2. **Test with [APS Postman Collection](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-api-postman-collection)**\r\n3. **Ask in [RAPS Discord](https://discord.gg/raps-community)**\r\n\r\n### Debugging Commands\r\n```bash\r\n# Comprehensive auth diagnosis\r\nraps auth diagnose\r\n\r\n# Test specific scope combination\r\nraps auth test-scopes --scopes data:read,bucket:create --endpoint /oss/v2/buckets\r\n\r\n# Generate auth report for support\r\nraps auth support-report --sanitize\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**💡 Pro Tip:** Use `raps auth status` regularly to verify your current scopes match your intended operations. RAPS will warn you if you're attempting operations without proper permissions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Last verified: January 2026 against APS Authentication API v2 and RAPS v4.2.1*  \r\n*OAuth scopes may evolve.

Automation Patterns Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Document Version**: v4.2 (January 2026)  \r\n**RAPS Version**: 4.2.1 (with MCP Server v1.2.0)  \r\n**APS API Coverage**: Data Management v1, Model Derivative v2, OSS v2, Authentication v2, Construction Cloud v1, Design Automation v3  \r\n**Integration Support**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes  \r\n**AI Features**: Natural Language Operations via MCP Protocol v1.2.0  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Common Automation Workflows\r\n\r\n### 🚀 File Processing Pipeline\r\n```bash\r\n# Pattern: Upload → Process → Download → Notify\r\nraps workflow create \"standard-processing\" \\\r\n  --steps \"upload,translate,download,notify\" \\\r\n  --retry-on-failure \\\r\n  --parallel-execution\r\n\r\n# One-liner implementation\r\nraps pipeline run \\\r\n  --input \"*.dwg\" \\\r\n  --output \"./processed/\" \\\r\n  --formats \"svf,pdf\" \\\r\n  --webhook \"$COMPLETION_URL\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 📁 Project Synchronization\r\n```bash\r\n# Pattern: Sync local directory with APS project\r\nraps sync configure \\\r\n  --local \"./project-files/\" \\\r\n  --remote \"aps://project/b.12345678-1234\" \\\r\n  --bidirectional \\\r\n  --exclude-patterns \"*.tmp,*.bak\"\r\n\r\n# Continuous sync with change detection\r\nraps sync watch --auto-upload --conflict-resolution newest\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 🔄 Multi-Environment Deployment\r\n```bash\r\n# Pattern: Dev → Staging → Production\r\nraps deploy pipeline \\\r\n  --source-env development \\\r\n  --target-env staging \\\r\n  --approval-required \\\r\n  --rollback-on-failure\r\n\r\n# Automated promotion with validation\r\nraps deploy promote \\\r\n  --from staging \\\r\n  --to production \\\r\n  --validate-before \\\r\n  --health-checks \"api,permissions,quotas\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Enterprise Automation Strategies\r\n\r\n### 📊 Batch Processing Optimization\r\n\r\n#### Large-Scale File Operations\r\n```bash\r\n# Process 10,000+ files efficiently\r\nraps batch optimize \\\r\n  --chunk-size 100 \\\r\n  --parallel-workers 20 \\\r\n  --memory-limit 4GB \\\r\n  --rate-limit-adaptive\r\n\r\n# Queue-based processing for stability\r\nraps queue create processing-queue \\\r\n  --workers 10 \\\r\n  --retry-attempts 3 \\\r\n  --dead-letter-queue failed-processing\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Smart Resource Management\r\n```bash\r\n# Automatic resource scaling based on load\r\nraps autoscale configure \\\r\n  --metric queue-length \\\r\n  --scale-up-threshold 100 \\\r\n  --scale-down-threshold 10 \\\r\n  --min-workers 5 \\\r\n  --max-workers 50\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 🔐 Security Automation\r\n\r\n#### Token Management\r\n```bash\r\n# Automated token rotation\r\nraps auth rotate \\\r\n  --schedule \"0 2 * * 0\" \\\r\n  --notify-before 24h \\\r\n  --update-services

external operations  \r\n- **Monitor performance** metrics continuously\r\n- **Automate token rotation** for security\r\n- **Use batch operations** for efficiency\r\n- **Cache frequently accessed** data\r\n- **Log all operations** for audit trails\r\n\r\n### ❌ Don'ts  \r\n- **Never hardcode credentials** in scripts\r\n- **Don't ignore rate limits** - implement backoff\r\n- **Avoid sequential processing** of large datasets\r\n- **Don't skip validation** of input data\r\n- **Never bypass error handling** for speed\r\n- **Don't run operations** without monitoring\r\n- **Avoid manual processes** that can be automated\r\n\r\n### 🎯 Optimization Tips\r\n```bash\r\n# Profile your operations\r\nraps profile operation upload-batch --analyze\r\n\r\n# Use parallel processing wisely\r\nraps config optimize --workload-type batch-heavy\r\n\r\n# Monitor and adjust based on metrics\r\nraps metrics analyze --recommendations\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Emergency Automation\r\n\r\n### Incident Response\r\n```bash\r\n# Automated incident response\r\nraps incident create high-api-errors \\\r\n  --auto-investigate \\\r\n  --escalation-path \"team-lead → manager → director\" \\\r\n  --resolution-sla 4h\r\n\r\n# Emergency procedures\r\nraps emergency execute traffic-divert \\\r\n  --from problematic-region \\\r\n  --to healthy-regions \\\r\n  --duration 30min\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Business Continuity\r\n```bash\r\n# Automatic failover\r\nraps failover configure \\\r\n  --health-check endpoint \\\r\n  --failure-threshold 3 \\\r\n  --recovery-delay 5min \\\r\n  --rollback-if-worse\r\n\r\n# Service degradation handling\r\nraps degradation configure \\\r\n  --preserve-core-functions \\\r\n  --disable-non-essential \\\r\n  --user-notification automatic\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**📚 More Resources**:\r\n- **Pattern Library**: [rapscli.xyz/patterns](https://rapscli.xyz/patterns)\r\n- **Best Practices**:

for the most common APS workflow: upload a CAD file, translate it to web-viewable format, and display in browser**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nTransform a CAD file (`.dwg`, `.rvt`, `.ipt`, etc.) into a 3D model viewable in any web browser.\r\n\r\n**What you'll achieve:**\r\n- Upload CAD files to cloud storage\r\n- Convert files to web-optimized 3D format (SVF2)\r\n- Display interactive 3D models in browser\r\n- Extract model properties and metadata\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### Required Tools\r\n- ✅ **RAPS CLI** v4.2.0+ installed\r\n- ✅ **Autodesk Developer Account** with app credentials\r\n- ✅ **CAD file** to test with (`.dwg`, `.rvt`, `.ipt`, `.f3d`, etc.)\r\n- ✅ **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\r\n\r\n### Required Scopes\r\n```bash\r\n# Authentication scopes needed for this workflow\r\ndata:read bucket:read bucket:create viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Files Used in This Recipe\r\n- `model.rvt` - Sample Revit file (replace with your CAD file)\r\n- `my-bucket` - Bucket name (replace with your unique bucket name)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Manual Way (50+ Lines of Code)\r\n\r\nTo appreciate what RAPS does, here's the manual approach:\r\n\r\n\u003Cdetails>\r\n\u003Csummary>🔍 Click to see manual implementation (JavaScript example)\u003C/summary>\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst axios = require('axios');\r\nconst fs =

Creates bucket if needed\r\n2. Uploads the file\r\n3. Starts translation to SVF2\r\n4. Waits for completion\r\n5. Opens browser viewer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Workflow Variations\r\n\r\n### Batch Processing Multiple Files\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Upload and translate multiple files\r\nraps workflow batch-translate *.dwg --bucket cad-drawings --formats svf2,pdf --parallel 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Extract Properties Only\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Get model metadata without viewing\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats properties --output metadata.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom Translation Formats\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Translate to multiple formats for different uses\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2,stl,obj,pdf --wait\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Webhook Integration\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Set up webhook to get notified when translations complete\r\nraps webhook create --event extraction.finished --callback https://your-app.com/webhook\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\r\n\r\n### Issue 1: \"Bucket already exists\" Error\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Bucket name conflicts  \r\n**Solution:** Use timestamps or UUIDs in bucket names\r\n```bash\r\n# Add timestamp to ensure uniqueness\r\nBUCKET_NAME=\"my-project-$(date +%s)\"\r\nraps bucket create $BUCKET_NAME\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 2: Translation Fails\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Unsupported file format or corrupted file  \r\n**Solution:** Check file and format support\r\n```bash\r\n# Check translation status with details\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn> --verbose\r\n\r\n# Retry with different format\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf --retry\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 3: Viewer Shows \"Loading...\" Forever\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Translation not complete or token expired  \r\n**Solution:** Check translation status and refresh auth\r\n```bash\r\n# Verify translation completed successfully\r\nraps translate status \u003Curn>\r\n\r\n# Refresh authentication if needed\r\nraps auth refresh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 4: File Upload Fails\r\n\r\n**Problem:** File too large or network issues  \r\n**Solution:** Check file size and use resumable upload\r\n```bash\r\n# Check file size (max 100MB for standard upload)\r\nls -lh model.rvt\r\n\r\n# Use chunked upload for large files\r\nraps oss upload model.rvt my-bucket --chunked --chunk-size 10MB\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue 5: Permission Denied\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Missing required scopes  \r\n**Solution:** Re-authenticate with correct scopes\r\n```bash\r\n# Check current scopes\r\nraps auth status --scopes\r\n\r\n# Re-login with required scopes\r\nraps auth login --scopes bucket:read,bucket:create,data:read,viewables:read\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance Tips\r\n\r\n### 1. Use SVF2 Format\r\n\r\nSVF2 loads 50% faster than legacy SVF format:\r\n```bash\r\n# Always prefer SVF2 for new projects\r\nraps translate \u003Curn> --formats svf2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Pre-create Buckets\r\n\r\nCreate buckets once, reuse many times:\r\n```bash\r\n# Create project bucket\r\nraps bucket create my-project-models\r\n\r\n# Upload multiple files to same bucket\r\nraps oss upload model1.rvt my-project-models\r\nraps oss upload model2.dwg my-project-models\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3.

model information\r\nraps translate metadata \u003Curn>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output example:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"Office Building\",\r\n    \"guid\": \"12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789012\",\r\n    \"role\": \"3D\",\r\n    \"units\": \"feet\",\r\n    \"up_vector\": [0, 0, 1],\r\n    \"front_vector\": [0, 1, 0],\r\n    \"world_bounding_box\": {\r\n      \"min\": [-50, -30, 0],\r\n      \"max\": [50, 30, 20]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Extract All Properties\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Extract detailed element properties to JSON file\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --output properties.json --format detailed\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What happens:**\r\n- Finds metadata viewable automatically\r\n- Downloads all properties with pagination handling\r\n- Structures data by element type\r\n- Saves to structured JSON format\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Generate Summary Report\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Create human-readable summary\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --summary --output summary.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output example (CSV):**\r\n```csv\r\nElement_Type,Count,Average_Area,Total_Volume,Common_Materials\r\nWall,45,120.5,2850.0,\"Concrete, Gypsum Board\"\r\nDoor,12,21.0,0.0,\"Wood,

data\r\nraps translate properties \u003Crvt_urn> --filter-type \"Walls,Doors,Windows,Floors\" --include-materials --include-levels\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Typical BIM Properties:**\r\n- Element categories (Walls, Doors, Windows, etc.)\r\n- Material assignments\r\n- Level/Floor associations\r\n- Room/Space assignments\r\n- Phasing information\r\n- Type vs Instance parameters\r\n\r\n### Mechanical CAD (Inventor, SolidWorks)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Extract mechanical properties\r\nraps translate properties \u003Cipt_urn> --filter-type \"Parts,Assemblies\" --include-mass --include-materials\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Typical Mechanical Properties:**\r\n- Part mass and volume\r\n- Material specifications\r\n- Assembly relationships\r\n- Custom iProperties/parameters\r\n- Manufacturing data\r\n\r\n### Civil/Infrastructure (Civil 3D, InfraWorks)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Extract civil engineering data\r\nraps translate properties \u003Cdwg_urn> --filter-type \"Alignments,Surfaces,Corridors\" --include-elevation\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Typical Civil Properties:**\r\n- Survey points and elevations\r\n- Alignment parameters\r\n- Surface definitions\r\n- Corridor assemblies\r\n- Pipe networks\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Filtering and Searching Properties\r\n\r\n### Filter by Element Type\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Only extract doors and windows\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --filter-category \"Doors,Windows\"\r\n\r\n# Exclude structural elements\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --exclude-category \"Structural Framing,Structural Columns\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Filter by Property Values\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Only elements with specific material\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --filter-property \"Material=Concrete\"\r\n\r\n# Elements above certain level\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --filter-property \"Level=Level 2,Level 3\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom Property Queries\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Advanced filtering with queries\r\nraps translate properties \u003Curn> --query \"Area > 100 AND Material CONTAINS 'Steel'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Output Formats\r\n\r\n### 1.
