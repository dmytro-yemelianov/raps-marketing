# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## RAPS 4.0 Revolutionizes Autodesk Platform Services Automation with Enterprise-Grade CLI Tools

*New version delivers 95% faster APS operations, enterprise SSO, and AI-powered natural language interface*

**[LOCATION], March 15, 2026** – RAPS (Rust-based APS CLI), the leading automation tool for Autodesk Platform Services, today announced the release of RAPS 4.0, featuring groundbreaking enterprise capabilities and AI integration that transforms how organizations interact with APS APIs. The new version addresses critical gaps in enterprise APS operations, delivering unprecedented speed, security, and simplicity.

### Key Innovation: From Code to Conversation

RAPS 4.0 introduces the industry's first natural language interface for APS operations through its integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Users can now perform complex APS workflows using plain English commands, eliminating the need for custom API integration code.

"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how developers interact with APS," said [Spokesperson Name], [Title] at RAPS. "RAPS 4.0 doesn't just automate APS operations – it makes them conversational. A simple request like 'process all models in the production bucket' now replaces hundreds of lines of custom code."
